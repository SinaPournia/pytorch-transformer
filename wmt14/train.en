Res@@ um@@ ption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament ad@@ jour@@ ned on Friday 17 December 1999 , and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant fes@@ tive period .
Although , as you will have seen , the d@@ read@@ ed &apos; millenni@@ um bug &apos; failed to materi@@ alise , still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were d@@ read@@ ful .
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days , during this part-session .
In the meantime , I should like to observe a minute &apos; s silence , as a number of Members have requested , on behalf of all the victims concerned , particularly those of the terrible stor@@ ms , in the various countries of the European Union .
Please rise , then , for this minute &apos; s silence .
( The House rose and observed a minute &apos; s silence )
Madam President , on a point of order .
You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explo@@ sions and k@@ ill@@ ings in Sri Lanka .
One of the people assass@@ inated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr K@@ um@@ ar Pon@@ nam@@ bal@@ am , who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago .
Would it be appropriate for you , Madam President , to write a letter to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an President expressing Parliament &apos;s regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and ur@@ ging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation ?
Yes , Mr Evans , I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate .
If the House agrees , I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I would like your advice about Rule 14@@ 3 concerning in@@ ad@@ mis@@ sibility .
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again .
The C@@ un@@ ha report on multi@@ annual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually .
It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability .
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to sub@@ ver@@ t it would be legally in@@ ad@@ missible .
I want to know whether one can raise an obj@@ ection of that kind to what is merely a report , not a legislative proposal , and whether that is something I can compet@@ ently do on Thursday .
That is precisely the time when you may , if you wish , raise this question , i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report .
Madam President , coinci@@ ding with this year &apos; s first part-session of the European Parliament , a date has been set , unfortunately for next Thursday , in Texas in America , for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sent@@ enced to death . We shall call him Mr H@@ ic@@ ks .
At the request of a French Member , Mr Zim@@ er@@ ay , a petition has already been presented , which many people signed , including myself .
However , I would ask you , in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community , to make represent@@ ations , using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent , to the President and to the Govern@@ or of Texas , Mr Bush , who has the power to order a stay of execution and to re@@ pri@@ eve the condemned person .
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always uph@@ eld .
Thank you , Mr Seg@@ ni , I shall do so gladly .
Indeed , it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted .
Madam President , I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest .
It is the case of Alexander Ni@@ ki@@ tin .
All of us here are pleased that the courts have acqu@@ itted him and made it clear that in Russia , too , access to environmental information is a constitutional right .
Now , however , he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosec@@ utor is appealing .
We know , and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed , including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year , that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Ni@@ ki@@ tin to be accused of criminal activity and treas@@ on because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings .
These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Bar@@ ents Sea , and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament &apos;s position , as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted , clear as far as Russia is concerned .
Yes , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter .
Madam President , I would firstly like to compli@@ ment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that , during this first part-session of the new year , the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably .
But , Madam President , my personal request has not been met .
Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one , there is still no Dutch channel , which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of ex@@ ile every month .
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well .
Mrs P@@ loo@@ ij@@ -@@ van Gor@@ sel , I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Qu@@ a@@ est@@ ors &apos; meeting on Wednesday .
It will , I hope , be examined in a positive light .
Madam President , can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes ?
Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected ?
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998 ?
Why has there been no fire dri@@ ll , either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings ?
Why are there no fire instructions ?
Why have the sta@@ ir@@ cases not been improved since my accident ?
Why are no-@@ smoking areas not enforced ?
It seems absolutely dis@@ gra@@ ceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves .
Mrs Lyn@@ ne , you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done .
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Qu@@ a@@ est@@ ors , and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on .
Madam President , Mrs D@@ í@@ ez Gonz@@ á@@ lez and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice-President , Mrs de Palacio , which appeared in a Spanish newspaper .
The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session .
I would ask that they re@@ consider , since this is not the case .
The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio &apos; s intervention , on another occasion , and not to these comments which appeared in the AB@@ C newspaper on 18 November .
Mr Ber@@ en@@ gu@@ er Fu@@ ster , we shall check all this .
I admit that , at present , the matter seems to be somewhat confused .
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be .
Madam President , I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our dis@@ content over today &apos;s decision ref@@ using to rene@@ w the arms embargo on Indonesia , considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past ?
Today &apos;s decision not to rene@@ w the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there .
So Parliament should send a message , since that is the wish of the vast majority .
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to rene@@ w the embargo .
As people have said , the situation there is extremely vol@@ atile .
There is , in fact , a risk of a military coup in the future .
We do not know what is happening .
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people ?
In any event , this question is not pres@@ ently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday .
Agenda
The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure .
No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday .
Rel@@ ating to Wednesday :
The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission .
I would like Mr Barón Crespo , who made the request , to speak to propose it . That is , if he so wishes , of course .
Then we shall follow the usual procedure , hearing one speaker in favour and one against .
Madam President , the presentation of the Prodi Commission &apos; s political programme for the whole legislat@@ ure was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi , who reiter@@ ated his commitment in his inau@@ g@@ ural speech .
This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and , therefore , basically dict@@ ates this Parliament &apos; s political and legislative activity for the next five years .
I would also like to point out , Madam President , that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislat@@ ure . It did so again during this legislat@@ ure , in July , and then , in September , it voted once more to approve the whole Commission .
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens .
To this end , I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September , which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible .
The events of last week - which origin@@ ated outside the Conference of Presidents , that Conference being used simply to cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a di@@ lem@@ ma . Ei@@ ther the Commission is not ready to present this programme , in which case it should clarify it .
According to its President , it is in a position to do so .
Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio , I believe that , before voting , it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme , as agreed . Altern@@ atively , Parliament is not ready to examine this programme , as some appear to be suggest@@ ing .
My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen , debate and reflect , there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that , if the Commission is ready to do so , we still have time to re-@@ establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfil@@ s our duty to our fellow citizens .
Therefore , Madam President , I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote .
( Applause from the PSE Group )
Madam President , I really am quite aston@@ ished at Mr Barón Crespo &apos; s behaviour and the fact that he is now asking for this item to be put on Wednesday &apos;s agenda .
Mr Barón Crespo , you were unable to attend the Conference of Presidents last Thursday .
I am not critic@@ ising this ; it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them .
Mr Hän@@ sch represented you on this occasion .
In the Conference of Presidents , we had an in-depth discussion .
Your Group was alone in advoc@@ ating what you are saying now .
We then put it to a vote .
As you know , each chairman has the same number of votes as his Group has Members .
There was a vote on this matter .
As I recall , the outcome of this vote was 4@@ 22 votes to 180 with a few ab@@ sten@@ tions .
This means that all the Gro@@ ups with the exception of the non-@@ attached Members - but , of course , they are not a Group - were in agreement ; only your Group thought that we should proceed as you have proposed here .
All of the others were of a different opinion .
That was the decision .
I should now like to comment on the issue itself .
We have confidence in the Commission and in Rom@@ ano Prodi and , after a difficult procedure , as everyone knows , the vast majority of our Group supported the vote of confidence in Rom@@ ano Prodi and the Commission .
We believe , however , that the Commission &apos;s strategic plan needs to be debated within a proper procedural framework , not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the European Parliament , but also on the basis of a document which is adopted in the Commission and which describes this programme over the five-@@ year period .
There is no such document !
The Commission will present its programme for the year 2000 in February .
We have said , very well , if the Commission does not wish to introduce the 2000 programme as early as January then we will do it in February .
We have agreed to this .
After all , we do not wish to quar@@ rel with the Commission ; if at all possible , we believe that the Commission and Parliament need to tre@@ ad the same path .
However , we in Parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the Commission and we do not have to agree with everything which comes out of the Commission .
I should like us to be able to do a reasonable amount of preparation for the debate on the five-@@ year programme in our Gro@@ ups .
You cannot prepare if you hear a statement in this House and have no idea of its content .
The fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together .
That is why my Group firmly re@@ jects the proposal made by the Socialist Group .
( Applause from the PPE-DE Group )
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be re@@ inst@@ ated .
( Parliament rejected the request ) President .
Still on the subject of Wednesday &apos; s sitting , I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax .
The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda .
Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this ?
Madam President , I can hear a ri@@ pp@@ le of lau@@ ghter from the Socialists . I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda , because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter .
I do not know whether this information is correct , but the PPE-DE Group would , in any case , be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already .
Dec@@ isi@@ ons have also been adopted against a tax of this kind .
That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda .
Thank you , Mr Poettering .
We shall now hear Mr Wur@@ tz speaking against this request .
Madam President , I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering &apos; s lack of logic .
He has just been pre@@ aching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents , and now he is doing just the same .
We discussed that matter and we were unanimous , with the exception of the PPE and EL@@ DR Gro@@ ups .
As my fellow chair@@ men will recall , I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tob@@ in tax , but of whether one dar@@ ed to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it .
It is not a lot to ask .
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out , once and for all , the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion , particularly after the ti@@ de of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference .
We shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group &apos; s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda .
( Parliament rejected the request , with 16@@ 4 votes for , 16@@ 6 votes against and 7 ab@@ sten@@ tions )
Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate .
Thank you very much .
Madam President , has my vote been counted ?
I was unable to vote electron@@ ically , since I do not have a card .
My vote was &quot; in favour &quot; .
Indeed , if we add the two Members who have declared themselves , then the result of the vote would be ....
Madam President , the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote .
There is no room for amendments .
Madam President , in the earlier vote - and I will ab@@ ide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group .
That did not happen .
I would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group .
This is an important matter .
It would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perc@@ eive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis .
Madam President , I do not wish to re@@ open the debate , but I had also asked for the floor , to comment on Mr Barón Crespo &apos;s motion .
You did not call me either .
I regret this , but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there .
I am terri@@ bly sorry , Mr Hän@@ sch and Mr Cox .
I did not see you asking to speak .
Even so , I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes .
When we adopt the Minutes for today &apos; s sitting tomorrow , then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments .
This seems to me to be a work@@ able solution .
Of course , the Minutes for tomorrow &apos; s sitting will take into account any additional explanations .
I think this is a better solution than proceed@@ ing now to extremely time-@@ consum@@ ing explanations of votes .
Mr Cox , Mr Hän@@ sch , would this be acceptable to you ?
Madam President , if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not , and cannot , object to that .
If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote , I accept that but with reservations .
We shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes , as we always do , of course .
If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted , then we may correct them , if necessary .
( The order of business was adopted thus amended )
Safety advis@@ ers for the transport of dangerous goods
Commissioner , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I can be quite fran@@ k in saying that I welcome the Council &apos;s common position on harmon@@ ising the training of safety advis@@ ers for the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland water@@ way .
Firstly , we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96 / 35 / EC , which obli@@ ges the Member States to appoint safety advis@@ ers and to organise the training , instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly .
Secondly , by adopting this directive we achieve a ) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and tran@@ shipped ; b ) a reduction in distor@@ tions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c ) equal opportunities for safety advis@@ ers on the European labour market .
Thirdly , this directive , as it currently stands in the common position , guarantees - in particular because it con@@ fines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union ; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States &apos; bearing a high level of individual responsibility .
All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed .
Our amendments from the first reading have , I believe , been taken into account very satisfac@@ t@@ ori@@ ly .
They have either been accepted or trans@@ posed with no change in the substance , or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included , for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions .
The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport , which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive , is something which I would urge you to support .
By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force , we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay .
I would urge you to endorse this .
As an Austrian , I still have a vivi@@ d memory , as , I believe , we all do , of the catastro@@ phe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tau@@ ern Tunnel , where subsequent work to re@@ build the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense .
The renovation project , which la@@ sted for months , cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe .
The traffic which had to be diver@@ ted because of this stret@@ ched the pati@@ ence of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit .
In fact , all hell broke loose in some municip@@ alities in my province .
Pre@@ vention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-@@ trained safety advis@@ ers being available , so that the right action is taken in good time .
All the same , we must not content ourselves with en@@ acting European law to ensure greater safety .
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are trans@@ posed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards .
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to l@@ ament the lack of enforcement .
I should like to address one final point . We must not content ourselves with se@@ aling another hole in the safety net and sh@@ utting our eyes to the fact that , where transport safety in Europe is concerned , there is still much more to be done .
In this context , I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible , who is with us here today , to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit t@@ unnels in the future , so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale .
Madam President , first of all I should like to thank Mr K@@ och for his report which has , at its heart , the issue of transport safety .
The report looks at the issue of harmon@@ ising the examination requirements for safety advis@@ ors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road , rail and inland water@@ way .
I congratulate him on his excellent report .
The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament &apos;s ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament &apos;s other amendments has been retained .
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the en@@ act@@ ment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible .
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety .
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved .
Madam President , I would like to make a few comments .
I would like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and , secondly , the Commission for the proposal it has submitted .
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also , in fact , with minimum requirements .
This is a pity , in a sense .
Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , safety on roads , railways and inland water@@ ways is of key importance and , given the international nature of these types of transport , training for safety advis@@ ors should also be harmonised , therefore , as well as the requirements of the new AD@@ R , for example , which is under way .
This is important , but so is enforcement and there are , of course , a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this .
Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years , for example in Belgium , the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lor@@ ries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in f@@ og@@ gy conditions when really they should have pul@@ led off the road instead .
Or ships from Eastern Europe which mo@@ or adjacent to ships over here , with all the obvious risks that this entails .
Furthermore , it has transp@@ ired that research in the ports in Belgium , Finland , but also in Japan has shown that 50 % of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment .
In short , the issue is an important one .
If we look at the situation where safety advis@@ ers are concerned , in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advis@@ ers in companies as from 1 January of this year .
There will be major problems with enfor@@ cing this rule at present , especially with smaller companies , as these cannot afford safety advis@@ ors .
These smaller companies either dis@@ pose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which causes problems .
It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9@@ 00@@ 2 certificates possibly include the fin@@ er details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses .
The work is done . All that remains is the business of enforcement .
I would like to mention one final point .
With regard to enforcement , proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001 , that is to say in eigh@@ teen months &apos; time .
This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period .
This is not in itself anything d@@ read@@ ful , but we should priori@@ tise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road , rail and inland water@@ ways and incorporate these , as part of the acquis commun@@ au@@ taire , as soon as possible and present them to the acc@@ eding states .
Madam President , the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so .
The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks , known and unknown , for employees and the social environment .
Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements .
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive , 95 / 35 / EC , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods .
I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding exam@@ inations , although I would have preferred it if uniform , set standards and modules had been established , so that certificates would be of equal value internationally .
This , however , does not seem feasible .
Finally , the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can , therefore , give it my wholehear@@ ted support .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should first like to congratulate Mr K@@ och on his reports which , though technical , are nonetheless of very great significance for safety .
I should like to make just a few comments .
Firstly , I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fer@@ tile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety , be it on the roads , on the water@@ ways or at sea .
Consi@@ dering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998 , even though Parliament responded relatively quickly , this time lag is a little too long .
This is not just the fault of the Commission , but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well .
My second point has already been mentioned : it concerns the minimum standards .
In principle , I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and countr@@ y-@@ specific rules .
However , when it comes to safety , I am rather scep@@ tical because safety in Sweden , for example , is in principle no different from safety in Germany , Italy or Austria .
I can live with these minimum standards , but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully .
Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation .
My third point has also been mentioned already .
As you know , like Mr R@@ ack , I come from a transit country , where this issue plays a particularly important role .
We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilater@@ ally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries .
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum , in all countries , whether they are transit countries or not .
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr K@@ och , on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal ; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the ap@@ titude examination for safety advis@@ ers in the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland water@@ way .
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy , and in particular the transport group , is magnificent .
The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmon@@ ises the minimum examination requirements for safety advis@@ ers and , at second reading , we can accept the amendment on the proposed date , which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission , bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question .
Very briefly , I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission &apos; s priorities in the field of transport .
As Mr Simp@@ son has said very correctly , this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end .
The process of increasing safety marg@@ ins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day .
In this regard , I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the t@@ unnels , which Mess@@ rs R@@ ack and Swoboda have referred to , which , in the case of Austria , is doub@@ tless a very sensitive issue , and great effort should be made to improve their safety .
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently , the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves .
Margar@@ ine and a few ki@@ los of paint which , in principle , do not present risks , led to a genuine disaster .
Therefore , we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved .
Finally , I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport .
This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport , in light of the Erika disaster , and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport .
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission .
As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster , we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety , but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances , which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem .
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur , Mr K@@ och .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Transport of dangerous goods by road
Del@@ ays in the C@@ EN &apos; s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive .
In particular , ann@@ ex@@ es cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments .
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job .
In this respect , I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94 / 55 / EC which has been tabled for discussion today .
Should the European Union fail to take action , then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period , until the C@@ EN complet@@ es its work , which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty .
The amendment to the directive on today &apos;s agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community .
It merely pro@@ lon@@ gs transitional rules by postp@@ oning deadlines , del@@ etes provisions which are no longer applicable , and lays down the procedures for a ) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b ) en@@ acting less stringent national regulations , in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas .
The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ; the Member States obtain more powers .
The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own .
In so doing , it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure .
The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers confer@@ red on the Commission were laid down af@@ res@@ h in the Council Decision of June 1999 .
The proposal to be discussed today , to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road , dates from May 1999 , however , and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure .
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure .
We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the rec@@ it@@ als and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly wor@@ ded - is set at a maximum of three months .
In addition , the need for greater transparency has been pointed out .
A further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements , in particular for vacuum tanks , if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -@@ 20@@ º@@ C .
This is in the special interest of northern European regions .
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and t@@ ank@@ ers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it .
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety , but I would ask you to endorse this report .
Mr President , colleagues , a happy new year and millenni@@ um to you all .
I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session , so this is quite exciting for me , a little like first love , although that did last longer than two minutes .
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission &apos; s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road .
It is good that this directive should be established now , as , otherwise , Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time , a period of transition , which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy .
The Commission &apos; s proposal , however , does not take account of all the facts , such as the cold climate that prev@@ ails in the northern regions .
Consequently , I have tabled some amendments to Mr K@@ och &apos; s in@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally excellent report , which have been adopted by our committee .
My amendments concern the fro@@ st-@@ resistance ratings for t@@ ank@@ ers carrying these dangerous goods .
According to the Commission &apos; s proposal -@@ 20@@ º@@ C would have been sufficient .
On the shores of the Mediterranean , it is hard to imagine that in La@@ pl@@ and temperatures can fall considerably lower than that .
There is support for the EU in La@@ pl@@ and also , so let us remember them .
I have thus proposed that the fro@@ st rating be lower@@ ed to -@@ 40@@ º@@ C .
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously .
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow &apos; s vote .
Mr President , with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admir@@ ation for the way in which you executed the quick chan@@ ge@@ over of the chair@@ manship just now during the debate .
I thought that it was quite superb .
On the subject at hand , I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe &apos;s roads , railways , and so on are as safe as possible .
This directive is a contribution to this .
What we are doing today is essentially a nu@@ is@@ ance .
The rapporteur , Mr K@@ och , to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this , has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the in@@ activity on the part of the C@@ EN , which has been very di@@ lat@@ ory in drawing up and adapting the directive .
That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that , in 2001 , we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer .
Mr President , the report we are discussing here does not , in itself , ent@@ ail any major changes . Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature .
It is nonetheless worth emphas@@ ising that , each time we make this type of decision , it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for explo@@ iting the possibilities of the internal market .
Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU , both on roads and railways and by sea .
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind . In area after area , we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States .
This is extra@@ ordin@@ arily positive , and there is cause to thank the rapporteur , Mr K@@ och , for the work he has put in on this issue .
This is also important where the prerequ@@ is@@ ites for the internal market are concerned .
If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running , it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also , as far as possible , apply to every country .
I should like to conclude by comm@@ enting on a third matter which is also of significance , namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament , Mr A@@ ri V@@ at@@ anen .
In many ways , the prerequ@@ is@@ ites differ from one Member State to another .
By appro@@ ving this amendment , we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union .
This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind .
It is good that , in establishing the present regulations , we can also be flexible . I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment .
Mr President , I would like to thank not only Mr K@@ och , but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and un@@ ambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority .
The reason Mr K@@ och produced his sound report was because the work in the C@@ EN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceed@@ ing none too ex@@ pedi@@ ti@@ ously .
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations , and whether the EU is in a position to ha@@ sten these harmonisation efforts , in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible .
For one thing is clear : even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union , traffic does not stop at our borders , it goes beyond them .
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions .
If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the C@@ EN and the Economic Commission are at ?
Mr President , I would once again like to congratulate Mr K@@ och on his magnificent work on this other report , which in a way suppl@@ ements the debate which we held in October on rail transport .
We all regret that the European Committee for Stand@@ ardis@@ ation ( C@@ EN ) has not been able , in the required time , to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union .
This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differenti@@ ating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours .
A moment ago , Mr V@@ at@@ anen spoke to us of lower temperatures , not of 20 degrees below zero , but of 40 degrees below zero .
Of course , we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the clim@@ atic diversity of the European Union , which sometimes take the form of specific@@ s and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and character@@ is@@ ations of a technical nature .
I would like to say , with regard to Mr Swoboda &apos; s comments on the activity of the C@@ EN , that we are ur@@ ging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if , despite the new deadline , we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded .
Lastly , Mr President , the basic problems justi@@ fying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out . We have referred to the delay by the C@@ EN , the amendment of certain provisions , the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the ann@@ ex@@ es and the need to for it to be more specific .
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur , Mr K@@ och , which are contained in the various amendments , specifically four .
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination
The next item is the report ( A5-0@@ 108 / 1999 ) by Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund : guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-@@ 2006 &#91; COM ( 1999 ) 3@@ 44 - C5-0@@ 12@@ 2 / 1999 - 1999 / 2@@ 12@@ 7 ( CO@@ S ) &#93; .
Mr President , it is particularly pleas@@ ing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament , namely Wales .
A major part of Wales , as you know , has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme .
It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to allevi@@ ate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face .
We have seen poverty growing in Wales ; and growing still further since 1997 .
We have seen the gap between rich and poor wi@@ den .
We are looking , therefore , within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Princip@@ ality .
What is , however , deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been , in a sense , a success of the government .
It is s@@ adly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces .
That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the for@@ efront .
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to addi@@ tionality .
We are dis@@ satisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures .
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects .
We look to it to challenge the UK Government , to ensure that the private sector , which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure , is involved in the planning stage .
Finally , we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund mon@@ ies are spent in a way which is transparent .
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent .
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales .
Mr President , our committee views these issues very differently and , to start , I will speak from the point of view of research .
We see it as a very positive sign that , in her own conclusions , the rapporteur has taken account of our committee &apos; s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should bro@@ aden the research infrastructure by loc@@ ating universities and coll@@ eg@@ es in such a way that they would serve those who live in un@@ developed regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts .
This will be possible with action on the part of governments , and such decentr@@ alisation of higher education will be an un@@ question@@ ably useful policy in evening out development .
Another matter we would like to address , specifically from the point of view of industrial policy , is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services , electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet , when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds .
Po@@ ver@@ ty and wealth used to depend more on means of livel@@ ihood .
The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry , but today those areas might have become a burden , and they may well be poor , meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production , as I might call it , and the production of services , because they are the industries of the future .
In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this , so on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , I would draw the Commission &apos; s attention to this issue .
Finally , as the committee representing energy , we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more , thus , through a process of coordination , increasing the use of renew@@ ables so that the sc@@ ant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compens@@ ated by means of these more substantial sums .
Mr President , I would very much like to thank Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague , Mrs F@@ lau@@ tre , who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill .
I would like to draw people &apos;s attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion .
In the past , this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment .
These amendments also fit in with this Parliament &apos;s view that social exclusion is a serious issue need@@ ing constructive action .
We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment .
In her report , Mrs F@@ lau@@ tre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sor@@ ely lacking , yet desper@@ ately needed .
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund .
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be reg@@ ret@@ ted , as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-@@ 2006 programme .
It could be said that the om@@ is@@ sion gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance , which is subject to review after three and a half years , and the Member States &apos; annual national plans for employment .
We hope that the Commission can re@@ assure us that this was an over@@ sight which is now being dealt with construc@@ tively .
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposal presented by the Commission , in accordance with its mandate , is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
I would like to point out , however , that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us : maintaining a population in rural areas , given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture &apos; s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society .
This , as well as the defic@@ ien@@ cies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment , which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity , exacerb@@ ates the exo@@ dus from rural areas .
The consequences do not insp@@ ire hope .
It is the young people who are dis@@ appearing , who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas , all of which has an un@@ favourable effect on those areas .
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs .
We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fif@@ ths of the territory of the European Union .
Agriculture only provides 5.@@ 5 % of employment in the Union .
Furthermore , three quarters of our farm workers are part-@@ time and require suppl@@ ements to their incomes .
Therefore , we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set . We want rural areas , at the da@@ wn of the 21st century , to be competitive and multi-@@ functional , both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-@@ agricultural activities .
It is important to priori@@ tise general criteria for land planning and demographic equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um , and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues , which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport , Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17 .
In conclusion , I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that , for the European Union , maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , the rapporteur , for her work .
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well .
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formul@@ as have needed to be reached in the face of this av@@ al@@ anche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing .
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament , at least in spirit , because at this stage , it might seem as though what we are doing here is a us@@ eless exercise , and nothing but hot air .
The truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament , particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives .
In our amendments , we have stated the importance of the necessary syn@@ ergies being produced between the Structural Funds , the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives , so that their application should be reflected , in the best and most profitable way , by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are , when all is said and done , the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing .
In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for at@@ taining these objectives , we think that those who generate employment , the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment , that is , busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople , must participate in this initiative .
Small and medium-sized businesses , above all , need to take part in the distribution of these funds .
If they do not , if busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople feel margin@@ alised , if entrepreneurs cannot take part , not only in managing but also in receiving these funds , we will have missed an opportunity to at@@ tain our objectives more rapidly .
Also , in order to at@@ tain our objectives , to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment , it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies , to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies .
All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business , which , by un@@ iting its efforts with those of public administrations , but compl@@ ement@@ ing them , never ob@@ struc@@ ting or excluding them , will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs .
Mr President , it is inc@@ umb@@ ent upon me to remind my colleague , Mr Evans , of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status .
It was because of the dis@@ credited policies of his own Conserv@@ ative Party .
Let me also remind him that when his party leader , Mr Hague , was Secretary of State for Wales , he broke every rule in the book on addi@@ tionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner W@@ ul@@ f-@@ Ma@@ th@@ ies regarding regulatory requirements .
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 addi@@ tionality .
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation .
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today .
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines .
The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic re@@ generation , to get the most effective use of resources in the wi@@ dest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-@@ support machine .
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi@@ -@@ tech sector .
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi@@ -@@ tech growth industries of the future .
The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instruc@@ tive in telling us what guidelines should not be about .
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape .
They should not be about shi@@ fting priorities and policies hal@@ f@@ way through project development , resulting in inevitable delays and under@@ sp@@ ends , particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement .
The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the Commission or in the civil service .
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission direc@@ torate , while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes .
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad , indic@@ ative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund@@ -@@ users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of re@@ generation .
If we can in@@ ject a spirit of entrepreneur@@ ial activity into our poor and struc@@ tur@@ ally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attrac@@ ting substantial investor confidence , which will be the key to future success .
This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines : whether EU regional policy with a good , solid , enabling gui@@ del@@ ine , can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and struc@@ tur@@ ally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter for an excellent report .
She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report .
The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines .
We are badly behind now in this matter .
Hop@@ efully , the stands Parliament has taken will help , however , in the mid-@@ term app@@ ra@@ is@@ al of the programmes and in their practical implementation .
For the time , the report grew too large when it was being debated . It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports .
At this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to ste@@ er Union regional policy , bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality .
Our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity , the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes . It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes .
Our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas .
We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes .
Pro@@ jects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect water@@ ed down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes .
Funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned . Pro@@ jects have to be carried out more efficiently , more flexi@@ bly and they have to be made more productive .
While the report was being prepared , it was interesting to discuss the Union &apos; s regional policy in general .
For us new members , it was the first time , and this was a very interesting process .
This report is very good and our Group supports it .
Mr President , Commissioner , as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consult@@ ative and sub@@ ordin@@ ate institution , the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group , Elisab@@ eth Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-@@ 2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission &apos; s offices for several months .
Mr President , we should not forget that the main , strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion .
We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results .
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regi@@ ons .
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion .
We might be mist@@ aken in using the gross domestic product per inhabit@@ ant as the sole indicator .
Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population .
We will have to study several indicators , which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others , and how they are evol@@ ving .
It is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament &apos; s plenary sitting today that Europe &apos; s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions .
This fact means that the European Parliament , the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisi@@ vely and strateg@@ ically .
I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity , as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives .
I do not think , however , that this report has come too late .
We need to consider it together , so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development , which have been drafted before the directives come into force , can be submitted for revision and proper assessment .
We all agree that we should ask that , hal@@ f@@ way through these programmes , when the assessment of the directives is made , Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens &apos; representatives .
Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is , at least on the face of it , bureaucratic .
They need to see the political dimension working , to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens .
This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for .
I would like to think that , given his previous experience as a regional President , he will agree to propose indicators , and a strategy , which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity .
Mr President , I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-@@ 2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following : there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds .
This means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent .
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for re@@ vit@@ alising relations between towns and rural areas . This latter point is of particular importance .
While urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city d@@ well@@ ers .
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone .
The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries , mainly through the upgra@@ ding of roads , water treatment and related transport networks .
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year , which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session .
Key EU programmes between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe .
The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date .
This would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ul@@ tra@@ peripheral regions , the poorer regions in Europe , are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone , as well as within an ever-@@ expanding internal market where the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital exist .
In conclusion , while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund , we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-@@ off in our society .
The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-@@ level institutions , financed our post-@@ leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment , assist early school lea@@ vers and promote higher standards of adult liter@@ acy .
Mr President , on numerous occasions in the past I have dis@@ agreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues . This time , however , I actually agree with her .
Whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path , I cannot say . Nevertheless , I would like to commend her on her work .
The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an ann@@ ex , as we and Mrs McCar@@ thy , as rapporteurs for the general regulation , had asked .
Unfortunately , this did not happen . Mr Ber@@ ni@@ é is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee .
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament &apos; s position .
Thirdly , we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not devi@@ ate from the comments we have made so far .
They are particularly beneficial to the Member States , and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development , job creation and , more particularly , on equal opportunities and transport issues .
Person@@ ally , I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines .
As an is@@ lander , however , I would like to express my dis@@ satisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development .
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves . This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament , and I have raised the issue time and time again .
Commissioner , we shall continue to raise the issue , as Article 15@@ 8 , paragraph 1 , of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands .
Therefore , the Commission should address the issue once and for all .
The time has come to implement the programmes , and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly .
As for us in Parliament , I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May .
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep ab@@ re@@ ast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes .
Mr President , Commissioner , in this minute and a half I should like , first of all , to congratulate Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter .
I know many have already done so , but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides , and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today .
I share the reg@@ rets she expressed , namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines , since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect , which in my view is a pity .
Consequently , I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-@@ term review in 2003 , and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003 .
In brief , I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-@@ 2006 , which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face .
The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies .
Subsi@@ dies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking .
We must ask ourselves a fundamental question : how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development ?
The second challenge is that of enlargement which will , of course , have a considerable impact , both in budgetary and geographical terms .
These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us .
Finally , in this time of natural disasters , I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds .
As you know , it is up to each State to re@@ distribute part of the total appropri@@ ation .
Europe should not be completely ab@@ sent , as the states tend to want .
Public opinion and the press nowadays acc@@ use us of being un@@ available to give a response , even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations .
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear .
I also think we should ensure , or ask Member States to ensure , that there is some public@@ ity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents .
Mr President , the priority given to financial and monetary criteria rein@@ forces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form .
As far as French planning experts are concerned , for example , the most prob@@ able scenario today is that of the entr@@ ench@@ ment of regional disparities within each country .
Well , the Structural Funds have helped to apply a bra@@ ke to this process .
Our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envis@@ ages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common den@@ omin@@ ator .
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of re@@ distribution instruments such as the Structural Funds .
What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax , which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level .
The Commission , however , though bound to issue guidelines , does so only reluc@@ t@@ antly and in a vague manner .
The report put forward today re-@@ establishes its place in the political sphere .
It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development .
This is what persu@@ ades us to vote in favour of it .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .
Over the coming years , faced with the challenges of globalisation and e@@ ast@@ ward enlargement , Europe will , more than ever before , require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and re@@ vit@@ alise its economy .
To this end , Europe as a whole , and each Member State individually , will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities , including the Structural Funds .
For this to be possible , what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions , but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States .
For example , in recent years Italy has had problems in utili@@ sing the Structural Funds , mainly because of excessive bureaucracy , insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level .
I will conclude , Mr President , by saying that the failure of the Commission &apos; s communication to focus on territorial p@@ acts and , especially , methods of combating unemployment among women and young people , is cause for serious concern .
Mr President , like my colleague Mr Evans , it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue , especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom , the West Mid@@ lands , which has hi@@ therto benef@@ ited from Objective 2 funding in particular .
But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how , if we are not very careful , we can produce very gr@@ andi@@ o@@ se-@@ sound@@ ing ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them .
The report itself is well-@@ inten@@ tioned but , as so often when we deal with these issues , lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for oper@@ ability .
That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and addi@@ tions to the text , not to take anything away from the proposal , but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide .
I would like to explain our thinking here .
Firstly , we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds .
P@@ ast experience dict@@ ates that , as the elected representatives of the European taxpay@@ er , we should , and indeed must , demand financial prob@@ ity and transparency in the dis@@ bur@@ sement and audi@@ ting of this money , hence our amendments and addi@@ tions relate to achieving what are known as &quot; value for money &quot; indicators in the gr@@ ant-@@ giving process .
Next , we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose out@@ comes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period .
But at the mid-@@ way point or end of that period there is no effective way of termin@@ ating the project if it has not proved successful .
Our addi@@ tions therefore call for the provision of practical enfor@@ ce@@ able exit strategies so that not only can we have the requ@@ isite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpay@@ er , but we also avoid the well-@@ re@@ hear@@ sed syn@@ dro@@ me of thro@@ wing good money after bad .
Finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are dis@@ bur@@ sed .
There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equ@@ ation .
Also the type of project funded needs to be shi@@ fted away from small-@@ scale re@@ ven@@ u@@ e-@@ based projects , which are hard to monitor , towards capital schemes where , in the majority of cases , the benefits are there for all to see .
That way the mu@@ ch-@@ tru@@ mp@@ eted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temp@@ tation to draw un@@ necessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be dimin@@ ished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform .
I urge the House to support these changes .
Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report , which is a me@@ ticul@@ ous and substan@@ tive piece of work .
The European Union &apos; s structural and cohesion policies are , without doubt , essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social di@@ spar@@ ity between the regions .
Despite the steps taken thus far , these levels are still very high , and are un@@ accept@@ ably high as regards unemployment .
These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thou@@ ght-@@ out and sensible guidelines .
Let us not forget that when these policies are effective , they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life .
Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hin@@ d@@ ran@@ ce to their economic and social development , unless of course the Commission is int@@ ending to build bridges or under@@ water t@@ unnels linking them to the European main@@ land .
In closing , I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millenni@@ um , for which we all hope for the best .
Mr President , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter &apos; s report undoubtedly contains several important observations , and I would like to congratulate her on that .
However , I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community &apos; s regional policy .
Quite briefly , structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way , rather it ag@@ grav@@ ates it .
The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irre@@ par@@ ably damaged by the existing regional policy , which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers , particularly in the South .
Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States .
If we examine the data presented in the sixth perio@@ dic report , we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities .
Little consideration , if any at all , has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infra@@ struc@@ ut@@ res structure , transport , communication and energy has resulted in their gradual dep@@ op@@ ulation .
The Union &apos; s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy .
A large section of the Union &apos; s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass@@ -@@ roots .
Unfortunately , the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented .
Mr President , I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union .
The first is the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion .
We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously .
We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union &apos; s fundamental objectives .
Secondly , I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention .
In future , we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as , in my country , the islands of the Az@@ ores and Madeira .
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to en@@ ligh@@ ten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission &apos; s report on the outermost regions , which has been long awa@@ ited by Parliament ?
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur , not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made .
Mr President , Commissioner , the guidelines are intended to help ste@@ er the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes .
However , contrary to their claim to provide guidance , the Commission &apos; s proposals in this respect are remin@@ is@@ cent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas .
Nonetheless , their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities .
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10 , to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects .
I should be very grateful , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliber@@ ations .
Mr President , Commissioner , in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , we uph@@ eld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women .
Unfortunately , the excellent Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter report did not take account of this criterion , despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Ber@@ end report - how , in fact , these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most back@@ ward regions in order to bridge the gul@@ f that separ@@ ates them from Europe &apos; s most high@@ ly-@@ developed regions .
They are growing , but only in terms of GDP .
They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions .
Commissioner , please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority , because this is our citizens &apos; greatest problem .
Please take account , in strategic terms , in the revision and in the allocation of reserves , of employment needs , because this , fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require .
Mr President , it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial sev@@ en-@@ year period 2000-@@ 2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation , particularly for women and young people , and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy .
It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas , employment in rural areas , aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which , of course , comp@@ rise half of the islands of the Union , as stipul@@ ated in Article 15@@ 8 of the Treaty .
Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally dis@@ regards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments , occa@@ sional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter &apos; s report .
So , ladies and gentlemen , I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , and the various Members of this House , have made .
Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines , Mr Hat@@ zi@@ d@@ akis , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter and Mrs McCar@@ thy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Obj@@ ectives 1 , 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds .
This means putting forward the Commission &apos; s priorities , based on past experience in implementing the programmes , as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations .
The objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use , to the optimum and efficient use , as some of you have wished , of Community involvement , including , Mr Bra@@ d@@ bour@@ n , using , if necessary , the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public mon@@ ies .
When I speak of optimum utili@@ sation , I am referring both to the national and regional levels . And so , Mr Sep@@ p@@ änen , I shall also mention at this point , speaking of the national level , the link with the Cohesion Fund .
This is the purpose of these guidelines .
Regarding their content , as you know , ladies and gentlemen of this House , they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but , at the same time , very passion@@ ately , as I understood her presentation just now .
The first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create , in all sectors , but especially in the private sector , as Mr Ber@@ end said , the maximum number of serious , worthwhile and permanent jobs , the competitiveness of regional economies , all regional economies , and in particular , Mr Evans , that of Wales , but not only of Wales .
And , because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an om@@ is@@ sion , let me also add the regional economies of the European regions handic@@ apped by their distance from the centre , be they remote regions , island regions or , of course , the most remote regions which are , naturally , the most distant .
Perhaps I may inform Mr Ri@@ bei@@ ro e Castro , who asked me about this , that , as I wrote to the pres@@ idents of each of these most remote regions , the Commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report .
Conc@@ erning the most remote regions , it was only quite bel@@ at@@ edly that we received the memor@@ an@@ du@@ ms from the various governments , but this is not necessarily an excuse , just an explanation .
We must therefore take these memor@@ an@@ du@@ ms into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work .
I myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 November and , within the College , we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions . I would thank you for your understanding in this matter .
So that is the first priority , the competitiveness of regional economies .
The second priority , which several of you have stressed , Mr Puer@@ ta in particular , but there were others , not that I am mentioning them in any order of priority , is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment , particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past .
In fact , the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account . The first is rural development , and let me say , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , that I am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport , an issue I have been involved in personally for a long time .
I particularly remember the time when I was Minister for the Environment in my own country . The second principle is that of equal opportunities , particularly for men and women , as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union .
Finally , and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this House , particularly yourself , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies , for development or re@@ development , which , of all the priorities , offer the maximum opportunity to syn@@ ergy , to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentr@@ alised partnership .
You expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership , yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines .
These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to them@@ atic priorities , since they must be taken into consideration , under each of the objectives , to different ext@@ ents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions .
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made , ladies and gentlemen , and firstly on procedure .
It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date .
Let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission , in the form of a draft in February 1999 , in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text , my predecessor , Mrs W@@ ul@@ f-@@ Ma@@ th@@ ies , presented them to Parliament immediately .
Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time , however , Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been defini@@ tively adopted , in July 1999 .
Here in this Chamber , ladies and gentlemen , among you , I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hat@@ zi@@ d@@ akis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned , your observations will certainly be taken into consideration .
And let me assure you , furthermore , that when the Commission adop@@ ts the guidelines with what we call the mid-@@ term review in mind , in line with the regulations , then the point of view of this House , as expressed in this report , will also be taken into account .
Now to the form .
On the subject of the role of the guidelines , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives , often very precise ones , should be provided .
I shall not list them all , but they include implementing inter@@ sectoral policies , increasing efficiency in the use of public funds , assi@@ sting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together , etc . The Commission takes note of these , but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents , such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the method@@ ological working document .
Dra@@ wing to a close , I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiter@@ ated , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter .
I am thinking , for example , of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations .
This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring &apos; s negotiations .
The Commission kept to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulations , which stipul@@ ates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad , indic@@ ative guidelines on relevant and agreed Community policies .
I actually quoted the text itself , in quot@@ ation marks .
Moreover , the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes .
You then mentioned , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development , pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration .
I find the opposite the case .
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission att@@ aches , and shall attach , to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy .
Indeed , I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere .
As regards rural development , which a number of you brought up , particularly Mrs Red@@ on@@ do Jim@@ é@@ nez , the guidelines are in line with the tw@@ o@@ fold objective mentioned by your rapporteur : a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas , but also protection of the environment and Europe &apos; s rural heritage .
It must , however , be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds , whose Obj@@ ectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversi@@ fication of rural society as a priority .
And indeed , on the subject of the balance of rural society , let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy co@@ financed by the E@@ AG@@ G@@ F Guar@@ ant@@ ee Section , aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multi@@ functional aspect of agriculture .
At this stage , I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas , in the way that the E@@ AG@@ G@@ F Gu@@ idance Section is for Objective 1 regions .
In any event , I appreciate the vigil@@ ance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter .
I shall therefore reserve the right , if you permit , si@@ r , to give you my own opinion , which , to a great extent , matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil sp@@ il@@ lage using Objective 2 .
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be appro@@ ving the Objective 2 z@@ oning plans for France , Sweden , Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow .
We shall then have an appropriate tool for working , particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the stor@@ ms .
Indeed , this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the stor@@ ms .
In conclusion , with thanks for your understanding , Mr President , I should like to thank you , Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , for the quality of your work and that of the committee , and to tell you that I am very pleased , apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines .
We have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view . I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines , which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes .
This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 199@@ 4-@@ 1999 programmes .
I feel this au@@ g@@ urs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions , at this time when programming for the period 2000-@@ 2006 is being undertaken , good joint working practice , which is , Mr Hat@@ zi@@ d@@ akis , backed up by something I am very attentive to : observ@@ ance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union
The next item is the debate on the report ( A5-0@@ 10@@ 7 / 1999 ) by Mr Ber@@ end , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the sixth perio@@ dic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union &#91; S@@ EC ( 99 ) 00@@ 66 - C5-0@@ 120 / 99 - 1999 / 2@@ 12@@ 3 ( CO@@ S ) &#93; .
Mr President , Commissioner , this sixth perio@@ dic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a mil@@ estone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth perio@@ dic report .
I consider , however , that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-@@ simplified view of the situation and , unfortunately , this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches .
The Commission report generally rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ es this observation , particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest , by which I mean the French overseas departments and , more generally , the most remote regions .
In this respect , I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and , more specifically , to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 2@@ 99 ( 2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Finally , in my view , this sixth perio@@ dic report presents interesting arguments from the view@@ point of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe , particularly when it out@@ lines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions .
Even if the Commission is still reluc@@ tant to say so in too explicit a fashion , its perio@@ dic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote poly@@ cent@@ ric development of the Community area through the Union &apos; s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the S@@ EC .
Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Ber@@ end has just presented and congrat@@ ul@@ ates the author , both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility , which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee .
The European Commission &apos; s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions .
I shall summ@@ arise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur , one positive and one negative .
The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major , although not decisive , factor in reducing regional inequalities .
The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmon@@ ising the European regions &apos; GDP and productivity than in harmon@@ ising its levels of unemployment .
It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation .
This , Commissioner , is the first comm@@ and@@ ment for the coming period .
Thus , Mr President , I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission , as other speakers have done , to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth perio@@ dic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-@@ 2006 .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it .
The sixth perio@@ di@@ cal report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union &apos; s regional policy aims . The report shows that growth has been un@@ even , despite all our efforts .
Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe . The strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average , whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly .
We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas .
Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of inter@@ regional differences , long distances , clim@@ ates that are too cold or too hot , spar@@ se populations and au@@ st@@ ere conditions ?
How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development ?
It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union &apos; s more remote areas .
The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility .
Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased .
This has chi@@ pped away at the results that regional policy has produced .
In the future , we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place .
For example , un@@ controlled migration has not been given sufficient consideration .
In this connection , too , weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development .
It is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how .
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report .
Mr President , Commissioner , the European Union &apos; s regional policy has , until now , not been able to interpret , in any significant way , the existing differences in our inhabitants &apos; incomes .
We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today , there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty , as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached , on average , 23.@@ 7 % in the regions worst affected , regions which also happen to be poor areas , whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment , corresponding to the ri@@ cher areas , unemployment stands at just 4 % .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Ber@@ end &apos; s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission in@@ as@@ much as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore .
The over@@ arch@@ ing objectives of the structural funds such as job creation , boo@@ sting equality of opportunity , increasing the sustainability of employment and development , are only mentioned in passing .
This attitude appears to me to be un@@ justified . I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the s@@ eventh perio@@ dic report .
This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness , particularly as I myself am an entreprene@@ ur in an Objective 1 Region , that is in Brand@@ enburg in the Federal Republic of Germany , and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises .
It is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the Objective 1 Regi@@ ons , that is to say job creation measures , special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business .
They are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities .
Support@@ ing only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development , simply because there is no basis for a self-@@ supporting up@@ turn in these Objective 1 Regi@@ ons .
After all , the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substanti@@ ates the fact than an increase of at least 3 % in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all .
Con@@ centr@@ ating to the exclusion of all else on supply and dem@@ and-@@ orient@@ ated economic policy is not the answer .
And those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and , to a less@@ er extent , in ration@@ alisation .
It is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a dem@@ and-@@ orient@@ ated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas .
The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions .
In other words , what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there .
For example , these would be measures for vocational training , for further education , for re-@@ integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process , for the flexi@@ bili@@ sation of working time and working time arrangements , in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again .
Mr President , my compli@@ ments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report .
The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union .
By stimulating a diversity of investments , the European Union is endeav@@ our@@ ing to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment .
From the sixth perio@@ dic report on the regions , one can draw the hes@@ it@@ ant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect .
The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase , not really a satis@@ fying result over a period during which , certainly over the past couple of years , there has been economic growth .
As indicated by the rapporteur , the effects of the structural measures , on the other hand , are minimal as far as employment is concerned .
Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for .
Also , the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pron@@ ounced raises serious questions .
Mr President , it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities , especially in connection with boo@@ sting employment .
It is , after all , they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their re@@ mit .
By allowing them to develop tail@@ or-@@ made plans for the relevant regions and , if necessary , t@@ ying this in with financial aid , a higher return can be achieved .
Sur@@ ely this must be the ultimate goal .
I am therefore in favour of the Commission deleg@@ ating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions .
Following on from this , it is probably also more meaningful , with regard to the financial aid to regions , to give Member States more say anyway .
By shi@@ fting the criteria from the regions to the Member States , we can avoid a great deal of problems later on .
Finally , I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries .
The report shows that , in general , they are a long way behind EU countries , especially in terms of GDP per capita .
With the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the fores@@ ee@@ able future , it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy .
I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later .
Mr President , Commissioner , following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part .
For example , whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decre@@ ased , there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect .
Equ@@ ally , unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all , indeed they rose in some cases .
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently .
Even the accum@@ ulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries .
Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment , then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development , improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training .
Gen@@ u@@ ine structural reforms and a competi@@ tion-@@ friendly taxation policy are the cornerst@@ ones of a successful economic base .
If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-@@ intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term , then the measures drawn up so far must be analy@@ sed .
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate .
Mr President , Commissioner , my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report , because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work .
This issue , which has an impact on their everyday life , is a key issue as regards EU credibility .
It has to be conc@@ eded that the EU has already ai@@ ded , I would say quite magnific@@ ently , the development of poor countries .
I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I dro@@ ve through those countries for the first time twenty-@@ five years ago .
In this connection , French speakers would speak of a &quot; coup de chap@@ eau &quot; : in other words , I take my hat off to the EU .
The EU really deserves such a gest@@ ure , but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great .
What is the result ?
People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a cr@@ ust .
Consequently , we have to build schools , hospitals , and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over .
This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems .
Most people , however , would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised , if they were given the chance to , in other words , if there was work there .
We must give them this opportunity .
This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have .
The solution , as I see it , lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneur@@ ship .
By entrepreneur@@ ship I do not simply mean the ownership of business , but creating will .
I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life , whether he or she is an employee , the owner of a business or an official .
What is a fair society ?
One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children .
In this way , positive development of the regions is also possible , because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance .
Finally , I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America , where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of en@@ vy , as it often is here in Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , as my time is limited , I shall get straight to the point .
Firstly , let me make a statement of fact : the fruits of growth are not distributed equ@@ itably within the Union .
The most remote regions , still hard hit by catastro@@ phi@@ c unemployment rates , offer one example of this .
In Re@@ union , for example , the rate is 37 % .
This is not a situation related to the economic climate , however ; rather it is a structural problem , created by our re@@ mot@@ eness , our ins@@ ul@@ arity , in short , our own specific personality .
The principle of specific , exceptional treatment was envisaged in Article 2@@ 99 ( 2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to deal with such cases .
It only remains to put this principle into practice .
The Commission document expected to be ready in December 1999 was delayed until January , then February , and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optim@@ ism .
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission .
As regards taxation , state aid , the Structural Funds and defending our traditional products , practical measures characterised by dar@@ ing and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency .
If these do not materi@@ alise , then , unfortunately , convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us , and it is to be fear@@ ed that the structural policy undertaken in our regions , despite the size of the amounts committed , will end in failure .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
( The sitting was closed at 8.@@ 25 p.m. )
Ad@@ option of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday &apos; s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Mr President , I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes .
I refer to item 11 on the order of business .
Firstly , I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the rein@@ statement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-@@ year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommod@@ ated .
I wish to express that view even if I resp@@ ect@@ fully dis@@ agreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group .
The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament , as other speakers re@@ marked yesterday , can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and syn@@ ergy with the European Commission .
There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this .
When there are major set@@ -@@ piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future , we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance .
There needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission .
We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fra@@ c@@ ture in institutional relationships .
Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday , I believe that the Commission and its President exerc@@ ised comm@@ end@@ able self-@@ restra@@ int in the way they comm@@ ented publicly .
That is something for which I have a deep appreciation .
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a mis@@ ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions .
It should not be dram@@ atis@@ ed into something more than that .
Thank you very much , Mr Cox .
I understand what you are saying .
We have taken note of this .
Mr President , concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business , we agreed yesterday to have the Bour@@ langes report on today &apos;s agenda .
However , it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on .
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today &apos;s agenda .
Mr W@@ ynn , that makes sense .
The report is her@@ eby withdrawn from the agenda .
Mr President , regarding Mrs Lyn@@ ne &apos;s comments yesterday about health and safety in this building , I pres@@ ume she was talking about the dra@@ ins because there is a d@@ read@@ ful smell of dra@@ ins on the fifth floor in the Tower .
This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong .
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building end@@ lessly , but this is a serious problem .
Mrs Ah@@ ern , we have taken note of this .
I would ask you to bring this specific case , which has to do with the venti@@ lat@@ ors on a particular floor , to the attention of the Qu@@ a@@ est@@ ors , who are , in fact , responsible for the matter .
We will also pass this on to our services , however .
Thank you very much .

Mr President , Commissioner , today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union &apos; s competition policy .
We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law , that is Mr von W@@ og@@ au &apos; s report , and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe .
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission &apos; s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term &quot; modernisation &quot; to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper , or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression &quot; retro@@ grade step &quot; .
However , we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998 , and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter .
But , of course , both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper .
It is all about the need for modernisation and the future vi@@ ability of the European competition policy .
On reading both Commission documents , one lear@@ ns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed , which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us .
Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this junc@@ ture . As the competent authority , the Commission , with its log@@ ically consistent approach , has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition , not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned .
It should continue along this path .
But , Commissioner , none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union , the deep@@ ening of the internal market , technological progress , globalisation .
Indeed , it is not just about modernisation of Community law , more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases , about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions , for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population &apos; s acceptance , together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned .
Only , without transparency there will be no acceptance , indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency .
The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but , in fact , there is nothing that could not be further improved upon .
Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought , Commissioner , but there is one point that I would just like to go into now . Transpar@@ ency and accountability belong together .
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question .
The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role , for the sake of its own independence ; but Parliament is a supervisory body , and what better forum could there be in which to ex@@ po@@ und the reason@@ ing behind one &apos; s decisions than a democrati@@ call@@ y-@@ elected Parliament , indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion ?
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen , strengthening and intensi@@ fying it .
There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though . Parliament is a legislative body , but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law , of all things , is truly sc@@ andal@@ ous .
Therefore , I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area .
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doub@@ t@@ ful cases , even given the Treaty status quo .
I also expect the Commission to be pro-@@ active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures .
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions .
With all due respect for the principle of competition , competition is not , however , an end in itself .
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions .
At the end of the day , one of the fundamental ten@@ ets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ide@@ olo@@ gue .
Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts .
But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own acc@@ ord .
Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses , monopolies law being one example .
But on the whole , this only serves to prevent abuses ; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation .
Competition yes , restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible .
However , since state aid forms the lion &apos; s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like , regardless of Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er &apos; s report , to say one more thing about it . It is certainly possible , indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educ@@ ating them in regional and environmental policy .
Indeed it must be per@@ missible for state aid to be provided for such purposes , provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition .
This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mer@@ gers law for decisions to be comprehensible .
It is not just that we should p@@ ill@@ ory state aid ; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinc@@ tions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the abo@@ ve-@@ mentioned objectives .
My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission &apos; s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87 , 88 and 89 of the Treaties .
The Commission report is essentially a descri@@ p@@ tive report detail@@ ing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors , according to various typ@@ ologies , such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued .
To put it pl@@ ain@@ ly , the level of state aid declared , roughly speaking , is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2 % of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent , coinci@@ dentally , of the Community budget for one year .
This being the case , there are considerable disparities between states , which may be measured in various ways , such as , for example , as a percentage of added value and per wage ear@@ ner .
I think it is also interesting to add state aid and Community aid , which may be assi@@ mil@@ ated in some way into state aid .
This clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the Cohesion Fund , among other things , which come at the top of the list .
This being the case , let me now come to the proposals made in the report .
We note , first of all , that the committee considers the data , as presented in the Commission &apos; s annual report , to be in too aggreg@@ ated a form to enable an in-depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate , sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition , pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty .
The Commission can only coll@@ ate and analyse the data provided by the Member States .
It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided , and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect .
It is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example , has champ@@ i@@ oned the long@@ standing idea of a public register of state aid , accessible via the Internet .
Having better , more detailed information available , particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded , must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies .
And in@@ sofar as such studies already exist , to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties , which are not only to ensure the competi@@ tivity of the European economy , but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion .
By stres@@ sing , primarily , the quality of the information provided , our debate in committee , and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you , avoided a simpli@@ stic response in the form of an a pri@@ ori statement that the level of state aid was , in absolute terms , either too high or not high enough .
Most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between , on the one hand , the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and , on the other hand , acknowled@@ gement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty , particularly , as I have said already , as regards sustainable development , research and development and economic and social cohesion .
This being the case , various amendments to the rapporteur &apos; s initial draft report were adopted in committee , particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbur@@ sement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a leag@@ ue table of results .
Seven amendments have been ret@@ abled for this plenary sitting .
Most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropri@@ at@@ eness and effectiveness of state aid , in view of the in@@ adequ@@ acies , acknowledged or not , of private investment alone , the market failures or in@@ adequ@@ acies of the market .
There is in particular one amendment , let me point out , concerning the energy sector , which , in my capacity as rapporteur , I see as particularly important .
I should like to conclude this presentation , Commissioner , by stres@@ sing two things : firstly , a concern of the members of the committee and , secondly , a demand of our committee .
The concern involves the pre-@@ accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , in terms of competition policy and state aid .
This is undoubtedly a complex issue , and one where we should like to see the Commission inform@@ ing us of the latest development in the matter , particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and , as far as state aid is concerned , the need , in all prob@@ ability , to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors .
And finally , in conclusion , our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing , competition policy and state aid , in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference .
As you know , Commissioner , our report argu@@ es that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid .
Mr President , Commissioner , my contribution to today &apos; s debate concerns the steel aid code , that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission .
There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these .
The EC@@ SC Treaty is due to exp@@ ire shortly .
Hence , what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future .
The European Commission &apos; s decisions , which feature in the report , are welcomed by the European Parliament , as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases , thus applying Article 88 of the EC@@ SC Treaty .
The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission &apos; s most recent communication , which we have not yet debated in Parliament .
As in other sectors , the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 ( 1 ) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry .
According to this article , state aid is irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able with the common market , in principle .
Ex@@ emp@@ tions are only permitted in precisely defined cases .
Under Article 88 , the Commission is obliged to super@@ vise state aid .
In 1998 , the largest case concerned the supply of company capital tot@@ alling EUR 5@@ 40 million to the PR@@ EU@@ SS@@ AG in Germany .
Furthermore , the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid .
The rules per@@ taining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996 .
These sti@@ p@@ ulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular , prec@@ is@@ el@@ y-@@ defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development , aid for environmental protection , social security to ease the closure of ste@@ el@@ works and aid to help non-@@ competitive enterprises cease trading altogether .
In addition , there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece .
However , there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report .
As far as Parliament is concerned , it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has exp@@ ired .
There must be no water@@ ing-@@ down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code .
No one wants an un@@ imp@@ eded subsi@@ dy competition in Europe .
This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market , regardless of the fact that the steel industry has under@@ gone consolidation in the past few years .
Consequently , Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry &apos; s claims about un@@ equal treatment , and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations .
We all know that so far the Council has dra@@ g@@ ged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind .
The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code exp@@ ires , they will be able to do their own thing again without the in@@ convenience of the European Commission &apos; s supervision .
We therefore demand that once the Treaty exp@@ ires , steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94 , for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity .
This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code .
A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments .
What we need to avoid doing in the future is com@@ promising competition conditions and distur@@ bing the balance in the markets .
We also need to critic@@ ise the Commission &apos; s practice of appro@@ ving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view , do not fall within the categories of the code , even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this un@@ equal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned .
The Commission will be called upon , in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999 , to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elabor@@ ation of restructuring plans and approved exemp@@ tions , thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made .
Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two ab@@ sten@@ tions , I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity , which we have ourselves created , in plenary sitting .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the internal market is not complete .
Subsi@@ dies , monopolies and barriers to competition are still imp@@ eding markets and development alike .
National governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time , but then it happens again .
Subsi@@ dies dist@@ ort al@@ locations , both within and between countries .
A succ@@ essive phas@@ ing out of State aid is required , and more and more markets must be opened up to competition . This applies to those which have been turned into monopolies , both private and public .
Public monopolies are , more often than not , ph@@ ased out reluc@@ t@@ antly .
Incre@@ ased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare , including within the sp@@ heres of education , health care and social services .
Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures .
Europe must be modernis@@ ed , made more entrepreneur@@ ial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies .
Eff@@ ective competition pus@@ hes prices down and raises standards of living .
It is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently . In fact , competition policy and consumer policy belong together .
The internal market is the basis for our work .
Its legislation is to apply equally to all , to large and small countries alike .
A systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismant@@ led . The EU &apos; s own regulations too may therefore need to be analy@@ sed .
The new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nation@@ alisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy .
In order to be effective , it must be well anch@@ ored in the Member States &apos; national authorities .
In six months &apos; time , it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation &apos; s effects upon the Commission &apos; s role .
The question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-@@ institutional congress which will open up an un@@ bi@@ ased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests .
This will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed . There will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate .
The law must be correctly applied in matters of competition .
W@@ ron@@ g@@ ly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership , which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for .
We have a quite exciting debate in front of us .
A conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to strai@@ gh@@ ten out mis@@ understand@@ ings , at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points .
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens .
In fact , in my own constituency of Stockholm , we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have ar@@ isen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies .
We would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by Mr von W@@ og@@ au and Mr Rap@@ k@@ ay .
We hope that the legal points of view will also be accord@@ ed the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law .
Mr President , as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my ma@@ iden speech here today , even though there has been a delay .
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von W@@ og@@ au , Mr Lan@@ gen , Mr Rap@@ k@@ ay and Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er , as well as the Commission , for their excellent cooperation .
Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story ; take the energy and telecommunications sectors , where there has been a demonstr@@ able lower@@ ing of prices and improvement in quality of service .
All this is to the good of the consumer .
But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further .
The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points : dro@@ pping the obligation to notify and retro@@ displac@@ ement of law enforcement .
Dro@@ pping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs , at any rate .
At the same time , this change of system will also lead to more on@@ us being placed on the individual in the business world , of course .
It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved ; for one thing , each person will have to take responsibility themselves , and that is probably why there is un@@ ease about this in other quarters .
However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a mark@@ er for less red tape .
The second point relates to the retro@@ displac@@ ement of law enforcement .
If we are to create a culture of law in Europe , then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission , by central bodies , but also by national authorities , by national courts .
We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally , it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty .
It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have re@@ course to the Commission in this matter .
The way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear , something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion .
But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy .
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could as@@ certain what state aid is being granted , then this would encourage the Member States to be more discipl@@ ined .
However , when it comes to what the future holds for competition , there are two issues dear to my heart .
One is subsidiarity .
We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency , and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions .
Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union .
I would c@@ ite , by way of example , the issue of job creation schemes , savings banks and regional banks , and G@@ üt@@ esi@@ egel .
Here , a region has , by its own efforts , created a means of marketing its own products .
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention .
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minim@@ is regulation .
We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other .
My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy , although I am not going to talk about market failure just now .
I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector , but I would just like to focus on a matter one h@@ ears again and again in certain quarters .
These days , someone who lives in an old people &apos; s home is accommod@@ ated within the social field .
However , I could also regard them as a customer , and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field , that is evol@@ ved structures , sti@@ f@@ le competition .
Apart from that , I could refer to any customers , any sector , as customers , and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields .
To conclude , I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity . I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes , they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to acro@@ ss@@ - the-@@ board regulation by Europe .
Thank you very much , Mr Rad@@ wan .
I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliament@@ ar@@ y-@@ speak , in@@ appropriately in your case , as a ma@@ iden speech .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member , Robert Go@@ eb@@ bels , who is unable to attend due to a political commitment .
Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , the Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er report has given rise to bitter contro@@ vers@@ y on the subject of the operation of the market .
A sli@@ m right-@@ wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures .
Even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ul@@ tr@@ ali@@ ber@@ al idea of a supposedly perfect market , it would not make any difference to the real world .
Economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources .
While , since the da@@ wn of time , the market has been the key forum for human inter@@ change , it has never been perfect .
The market fav@@ ours the short term and immediate profits .
On the market , the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weak@@ est parties , consumers and workers .
In order to function , the market needs rules .
The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society .
We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose .
The market is not an end in itself ; it must help to improve the human condition .
The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators , but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion .
Finally , aid can enable restructuring , offer training , save jobs and thus know-how .
The main objective of the Union &apos; s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid .
This aid must be align@@ ed with the objectives of the Union , particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research .
The Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hin@@ ders the internal market .
It would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid .
The Internet is not a product of the market , but the result of research financed by the American army .
The World Wi@@ de Web , which has enabled the met@@ e@@ or@@ ic development of the information society , was developed by C@@ ER@@ N in Geneva , once again with public aid .
The German Government &apos; s intervention to save the Holz@@ mann group was criticised as an un@@ justi@@ fiable constra@@ int upon the market economy .
President Du@@ isen@@ berg even attempted to attri@@ bute the weakness , the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interven@@ tion@@ ism .
I did not hear Mr Du@@ isen@@ berg critic@@ ising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the h@@ edge fund , LT@@ C@@ M .
W@@ ishing to save 60 000 jobs is , apparently , a sin against the market , but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market .
Public mon@@ ies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation , as was the case in Mexico , Asia and Brazil .
Human labour , on the other hand , is considered to be a simple factor in the equ@@ ation .
We Socialists reject the liber@@ als &apos; na@@ ï@@ ve optim@@ ism on this point .
We want a true culture of competition in Europe .
The state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge .
Mr President , Commissioner , I want to begin by thanking Mr Rap@@ k@@ ay for a good report and constructive cooperation .
I want to thank you , Commissioner Monti , for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that , as we enter the new millenni@@ um , you have an especially important role . It is your job to ti@@ dy up the m@@ ess left by national governments .
These may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy , but their capacity to w@@ re@@ ak ha@@ vo@@ c seems bound@@ less .
Let me mention the latest examples we have seen : Holz@@ mann , a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government ; sa@@ w@@ m@@ ills in former East Germany ; and , especially , aid to ship@@ yards .
These are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squ@@ ee@@ zed out of their markets .
I want to say to Mr P@@ oos that I very much agree with Mr Du@@ isen@@ berg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restruc@@ ture their economies and , to that extent , are helping to undermine the value of the euro .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democ@@ rat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee , all concerning state aid .
These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness , which is very important with a view to making the internal market work .
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal , Democ@@ rat and Reform Party .
As I say , our amendments concern transparency , and I should like to emphasise the amendment which ur@@ ges the Commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state ai@@ ds we consider to be lawful , specifically in order to ensure that companies can predic@@ t what their situation will be .
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared un@@ lawful .
How do we ensure that un@@ lawful state aid is paid back ?
At present , there are no common rules in this area , and we vigor@@ ously urge the Commission to make a point of harmon@@ ising the rules on re@@ payment .
This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition .
Finally , we propose keeping both a register , as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs , and also a sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid .
You have shown us the way , Mr Monti , with the single market sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard .
It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid .
I very much hope that you , Commissioner Monti , will support these amendments , and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter .
To conclude , I want to welcome the Commission &apos; s X@@ VI@@ II@@ th Report on Competition Policy , on which , once again , a good deal of work has been done .
But , as I have already mentioned , our over@@ riding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness .
There is still a need to tigh@@ ten up in the areas mentioned , and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resol@@ utely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid .
This is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union , and I should like to thank Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er who , in his report , has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria , as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition .
As Liberals and Greens , we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look , but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives , and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems .
Mr President , Commissioner , there are just two questions which must be answered .
Are state aid to business or inter-@@ company agreements legitimate in a market economy , and who must super@@ vise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy ?
Regarding the first point , we say quite clearly that , in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed , it is essential that , in some instances , there is state aid to businesses , be it in the form of tax exemp@@ tions , special taxation or even direct aid .
It is also legitimate for there to be inter-@@ company agreements and voluntary restra@@ int agreements , since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detri@@ mental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements .
So our clear response is that , yes , such aid and such agreements are legitimate , but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified .
The von W@@ og@@ au report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level .
We feel this is relatively dangerous , but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything .
We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact .
Mr President , once again we are debating the European Union &apos; s competition policy .
But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us .
The over@@ riding features of today &apos; s economy are massive mer@@ gers and acqu@@ isi@@ tions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ingly powerful multinational groups .
Should we not be discussing this issue ?
We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these priv@@ ate-@@ sector monopolies .
Cer@@ tain sectors of European industry , such as the ship@@ building industry , air transport and the steel industry , which have been hard hit by existing competition policy , have suffered tremend@@ ously .
They have lost their status , and a significant sli@@ ce of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant .
When will we debate that ?
The sc@@ andal@@ ous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving spec@@ ulative multinational groups economies the size of entire states , and Member States of the Union at that .
And yet , we keep on weak@@ ening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tigh@@ ten competition policy yet further by quali@@ fying public procurement contracts placed with public-@@ sector corporations as state aid .
At the same time , unemployment is spir@@ alling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs .
Wor@@ kers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights .
Con@@ sum@@ ers see their standard of living being ero@@ ded , poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismant@@ led and dis@@ solved in the name of un@@ ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ated and catastro@@ phi@@ c competition , in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the mon@@ opoli@@ stic interests of big business .
We consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it .
Mr President , Commissioner , in the course of this pi@@ vot@@ al year , prior to the chan@@ ge@@ over to the single currency , the Commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment .
The competition policy has , as far as these resources permitted , contributed to this event .
For our part , we remain staun@@ ch@@ ly opposed to the single currency which , far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency , impris@@ ons us in an artificial stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et , which has been imposed on the peoples of Europe .
Having said that , governing means planning . It also means being responsible and , in this new context which has been forced upon us , competition law naturally has an essential role to play .
In this area , the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action : acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-@@ competitive practices , by re@@ focusing its departments &apos; supervisory activities only upon matters with a mani@@ fest Community interest and by affir@@ ming its intention to modernis@@ e competition law .
As regards state aid , it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex , and the introduction of a public register , where all aid would be recorded , does not seem advis@@ able to us since this on@@ erous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints .
Finally , on the subject of modernis@@ ing the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty , we do not think that decentr@@ alised application would necessarily be going in the right direction .
The Commission is , in fact , re@@ taining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities , but clearly obli@@ ging the national juris@@ dic@@ tions to avoid disp@@ uting the decisions of the Commission at all .
National states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observ@@ ance of the application of rules which they do not control .
In conclusion , I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction , we shall of course remain vigil@@ ant in order to prevent the snow@@ ball@@ ing of Feder@@ alism which , if it were realised , would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states .
Mr President , Commissioner , we have a basically positive view of the Commission &apos; s White Paper on competition , particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation , but we are also pu@@ zz@@ led by several things .
In this respect , we should he@@ ed the words of von Ei@@ eck , and doub@@ tless also those of the great Italian liberal Brun@@ o Le@@ oni , who warned precisely against the risks of an ab@@ normal increase in anti-@@ competition policies .
State interference in the economy is , even today , still to blame for the most serious hin@@ d@@ ran@@ ces placed in the way of the market , competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers .
There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this , there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treas@@ ury controls 15 % of stock exchange capit@@ alisation ; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mer@@ gers and acqu@@ isi@@ tions ; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about V@@ od@@ af@@ one &apos; s bid for Mann@@ es@@ mann and the b@@ ail@@ out of Holz@@ mann .
Finally , Commissioner , we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state , ranging from state television , which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpay@@ er , and the Post Office , to some compulsory insurance schemes , including health and social welfare systems , which are managed by in@@ efficient state monopolies which leave no-@@ one but the weal@@ thy user with any other option .
Commissioner , I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties , but I believe that , it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy , especially because of in@@ sufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition .
What is being done may well be very important , but it is still not sufficient .
Mr President , we are holding a special debate : on competition policy and state aid , the government &apos; s right and left hand , so to speak .
Whilst the EMU criteria are forcing Member States to cur@@ b expenditure , the high level of state aid to industry has so far remained in place .
This is understandable , because it is highly likely that Member States which start to cut back on state aid will cause companies to leave , with adverse effects on employment .
But , at the same time , this is not understandable because bad management and non-@@ viable jobs should not be funded by taxpayers &apos; money .
In principle , only horizontal regulations are per@@ missible because they do not dist@@ ort , or hardly dist@@ ort , competition .
The rapporteur &apos; s Amendments Nos 6 and 7 , therefore , deserve our support .
Amendments Nos 1 and 5 make reference to the phenomenon of market failure because the market instrument in itself does not result in the ideal society .
Vul@@ ner@@ able people find themselves har@@ dest hit .
Market forces must be employed in a sophisticated manner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizens and companies .
If this comes to nothing , then the government has to step in .
The Commission &apos; s White Paper on modernis@@ ing competition policy seems more like a discussion paper .
The ple@@ a in favour of decentr@@ alisation in order to ligh@@ ten the load within the Director@@ ate-@@ General on Competition is a kind gest@@ ure , but the way in which the Commission would like to carry this through would lead to the judiciary being stret@@ ched .
This would be at the expense of legal certainty within industry .
Does the pressure of work within the Commission really decrease when national judges are required to report to the Commission ?
What is the Council &apos; s opinion on this and is the Commissioner prepared to completely re@@ consider these points ?
Mr President , a White Paper , by definition , is not something you can take or leave .
It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that .
It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense .
I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views .
I also assume that you , Commissioner , want to honour the reputation of , and the work put in by , your predec@@ essors and that your offices will pursue the same objective .
I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-@@ Europe@@ an@@ ise or re-@@ nation@@ alise in a thorough manner , but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless .
Firstly , these relate to the coherence of the policy &apos; s application .
In general , I am a great def@@ ender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market .
The internal market needs a uniform competition policy , not only in terms of concept , but also in terms of application .
It is true , there are some European regulations and interpre@@ t@@ ative statements on the way .
The Commission is also said to have the right of ev@@ oc@@ ation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities .
But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Ech@@ tern@@ ach proc@@ ession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward .
So , I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible .
Secondly , I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty .
Many do@@ ssiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern .
This instrument will fall by the w@@ ay@@ side in future .
In the White Paper , you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines , but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next ?
Thirdly , I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy .
I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection , as is already the case , one has got to admit , within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector .
Fourthly , I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the invali@@ dity penalty in the case of evident infrin@@ gements of the competition rules .
Fif@@ thly , with the pending enlargement , I wonder whether the candidate coun@@ ties will be able to play our game .
They are still in training , as it were .
What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the leag@@ ue of the internal market ?
Six@@ thly and la@@ stly , I would remind you of a point that I have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions , namely the legal privilege of company lawyers .
If the Commission impl@@ ements the White Paper objectives , it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advis@@ ers will become more pron@@ ounced and hence even less acceptable .
Is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege ?
Commissioner , I am asking these questions as a def@@ ender of the internal market and I hope that , in this sense , we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain steri@@ le but can bear fruit .
Mr President , I would like , in beginning my speech regarding the White Paper , to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr von W@@ og@@ au .
The fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure .
We are , therefore , in agreement with the report , Commissioner , as well as the broad out@@ lines of the White Paper .
Since the Treaty entered into force , Community law on competition has been one of the ten@@ ets of Community policy .
After almost for@@ ty years of being in force , these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaus@@ tion .
For this reason , modernisation was essential .
That modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons .
Firstly , the authorisation system ; secondly , decentr@@ alised application ; thir@@ dly , procedural rules ; four@@ thly , judicial application ; and fif@@ thly and finally , excessive red tape .
The system of individual appro@@ vals needed urgent reform , as was unanimously requested by specialised companies , academ@@ ics and lawyers .
I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system .
A system , such as the current one , which is capable of making so few decisions , be they appro@@ vals or prohi@@ bitions , is something less than a valid system .
National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 for some time .
However , they could not apply Article 81 ( 3 ) , which , to a certain extent , prevented the coherent application of Article 81 ( 1 ) .
You will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the Court of Justice , both brought by German courts , which question the feasi@@ bility of applying 81 ( 1 ) without being able to apply 81 ( 3 ) .
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary .
The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 17@@ 62 .
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous .
The fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure , that it did not establish time limits , that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files , or that the right to defence was not properly recognised , were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform .
The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994 , the Commission published a communication on this subject .
It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach .
One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape .
As a consequence of the continental legal tradition , consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-@@ competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market .
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis .
The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals .
It is also true that we note certain defic@@ ien@@ cies which have come to light in the report .
Amon@@ gst these , firstly , is the fact that , despite trying to modernis@@ e Articles 81 and 82 , Article 81 and not Article 82 carries exclusive weight . At the moment , with inter-@@ company agreements and the privatis@@ ation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consoli@@ dating them , the combating of abu@@ sive conduct is becoming particularly important .
Secondly , Regulation 17@@ 62 must be repe@@ aled and replaced with a new regulation .
For these reasons , we are going to vote in favour of the report .
However , if some of the amendments are accepted , particularly those presented by the PPE-DE Group , we would consider the report to be stri@@ pped of its value and to have become an in@@ consistent document , lacking in rig@@ our and , in that event , we would re@@ consider our support .
Mr President , amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate , I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Ber@@ en@@ gu@@ er , that is to say , the modernisation of competition policy , which is the subject of the Commission &apos; s White Paper .
Frank@@ ly , I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory .
If it functions well , if we are satisfied , if the Commission has basically acted correctly , why the need for the modification ?
Various arguments have been presented in its favour .
Mr Ber@@ en@@ gu@@ er made a very accurate analysis , justi@@ fying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition , but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States , are truly identical in all regions .
Because , if this is not the case , we will be faced with the parad@@ ox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market .
In that event we would not have moved forward , but rather back@@ wards , in the application of competition policy in the Union .
Mr President , I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XX@@ VI@@ II@@ th report on competition policy in the Union , when compared to previous reports .
I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur , Mr Rap@@ k@@ ay , who has dis@@ sec@@ ted this den@@ se and comprehensive text in such a conc@@ ise way .
I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the Basque Country , which I represent - a margin for action , by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity .
The only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval , through individual cases , which will take more than six or eight months to resolve , an exc@@ essively long period , which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility , affecting the generation of wealth and employment .
I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations , lay down clear rules , which will benefit all of us : busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople , investors , workers and the citizens in general .
Mr President , I would like to stress that , in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future .
From the point of view of economic growth , and therefore of increasing employment and wealth , safeguarding a competition policy in the Member States is becoming a crucial factor , and one that is certainly very important for our future .
This is why I give this report my full support .
Recently , I have noticed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner , precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility , both for products and for services .
I would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future , for Europe &apos; s economy , and , above all , for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general .
Mr President , for British Conserv@@ atives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union .
It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined .
The truth is that the single market is not yet complete .
During my six months as a Member of this Parliament , I have become ac@@ utely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project .
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe .
But all this , in effect , is so much rhetoric when we look at the national , regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market .
That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission &apos;s proposals .
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti .
We look to him as the man to root out car@@ tels .
But he would recognise that , as for everybody else , we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination .
That is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs , Mr von W@@ og@@ au .
I want to congratulate him , s@@ adly in his absence , for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thor@@ n in his side !
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support .
So although I may not share his conclusions , I believe he has illustr@@ ated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address .
The first is the potential for ren@@ ation@@ alisation of competition policy .
I know that the Commission is set against this , but the potential exists .
I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities . I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process .
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective ren@@ ation@@ alisation .
Mr von W@@ og@@ au said we can look to the European Court .
Well , we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment .
We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment , in which we have the support of the Commission .
Unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nation@@ alistic point , in the Fac@@ tor@@ t@@ ame case , in which the British Government was the def@@ endant , it took ten years for the European Court to give a ruling .
So , judi@@ cially , something needs to be done .
I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area .
In relation to legal certainty , I endorse the point made by Mrs Th@@ y@@ ssen .
It is important that business has legal certainty .
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently .
He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers .
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom .
We all have , as it were , our hi@@ stories to live with , but it is important that business has legal certainty .
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business : a cost-@@ benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy .
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change .
We have been told how , currently , people &apos;s time is being wast@@ ed and that the changes , therefore , could be beneficial .
But I really feel that , in the circumstances , we want to know what the implications would be for business .
Finally , we , as British Conserv@@ atives , are looking for a change in direction , towards the development of an independent competition authority .
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that .
Mr President , the European Union &apos; s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration began .
It is an integral part of the tension , inherent in the very concept of European integration , between solidarity and cooperation between Member States , with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy , and competition , which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future vi@@ ability of the European Union as an entity .
It is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies .
We can be proud of a European competition culture , for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality .
We can be proud of monopolies and mer@@ gers supervision .
However , we must be vigil@@ ant in the face of global operators , against whom nation@@ -@@ states are no longer able to impose limits .
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vi@@ vi@@ enne For@@ esti@@ er , who described the state of the world in terms of the economy &apos; s rei@@ gn of terror .
Society is sur@@ ren@@ dering itself to the economy .
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union .
We are aware that in this age of strategic alli@@ ances and millenni@@ um mer@@ gers - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with tak@@ e-@@ over@@ s - restrictive practices are being held in check , not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan , or others , until we get the international competition law we so badly need .
European competition policy , as we very often forget , is not just important for fair competition as such , but also for prices , growth and employment , and hence for the public .
In common with the other Members , I call for Parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned .
It is essential that this long over@@ due step be taken .
It is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection .
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament , as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations , consumer protection associations and the public .
Gre@@ ater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy .
Then it is possible to understand that , for example , lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to European competition policy , and Brussels should not be p@@ ill@@ ori@@ ed when aid decisions are taken which are , of course , bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context .
It is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement .
Emp@@ ha@@ sis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis .
At the same time , it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose , with a view to off@@ setting the defic@@ ien@@ cies of the market and fur@@ ther@@ ing Community objectives .
A word on the White Paper : the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy .
I am opposed to this , unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group , because I believe that , in competition policy terms , the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inf@@ erior to a system of prohi@@ bition unless certain conditions are met , and I believe there is a threat of ren@@ ation@@ alisation .
The system currently in force creates transparency , affor@@ ds enterprises legal certainty and has , without a shadow of a doubt , led to discipline and acted as a det@@ err@@ ent on account of the notification requirement .
The problem of over@@ work highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system .
Indeed , it is debat@@ able whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty .
Mr President , I am very glad that Mrs Rand@@ zi@@ o-@@ Pla@@ th mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so .
The adv@@ ent of the euro at the beginning of last year un@@ le@@ ashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a mer@@ ger wave of quite unprecedented propor@@ tions .
For example , the figures for last year now show that the total value of mer@@ gers in the European area was EUR 1.4 trilli@@ on , which is seven times the level of mer@@ ger activity at the peak of the last European mer@@ ger boom in 1990 .
This poses enormous challenges for competition policy , which I hope it will be able to meet because , for certain , many of those mer@@ gers are going to be designed to protect profit marg@@ ins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale .
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our wor@@ ries in the EL@@ DR Group are that there should be no weak@@ ening in the thr@@ ust of competition policy either in the examination of mer@@ gers or the monitoring of restrictive practices .
Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von W@@ og@@ au said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no sli@@ pp@@ age in the European element , and , particularly would ask the Commissioner to re@@ assure us that there would be random checks on that .
Mr President , in the limited time I have , I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here , in particular by Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er , who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid .
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82 , especially when we are witn@@ essing abu@@ sive conduct in a context of market concentration .
As a Member for the Basque Country , I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market .
I say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the Commission in general , and Mr Monti , in particular , for its persecution of the incentives to Basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid .
Mr President , Commissioner , competition is exactly what we need .
We need competition if there is the least unemployment , for a smooth@@ -@@ running healthcare system , for social justice , for high social standards , and , of course , we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve high@@ est@@ -@@ quality products , equal market access conditions for all enterprises , and environment@@ ally-@@ friendly products .
In other words , we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to man@@ ag@@ erial economics .
I often have the impression , unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is pri@@ zed above all else and competitiveness relating to man@@ ag@@ erial economics is dis@@ regarded , that very often the reverse is the case ; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of man@@ ag@@ erial economics .
I say that as an entreprene@@ ur who has a v@@ ested interest in this .
But a system cannot function in this way : it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand .
I will give you an example : the European Union was right to support the Gr@@ ön@@ itz ste@@ el@@ works in Brand@@ enburg , although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained .
But these are competitive jobs , for this ste@@ el@@ works is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany .
Anyone who would jeopardi@@ se production at this ste@@ el@@ works on principle , by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time , would not just place the ste@@ el@@ works itself in jeop@@ ar@@ dy but also one of the region &apos; s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are , of course , dependent on too .
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union &apos; s competition policy is designed to achieve .
If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-@@ requ@@ is@@ ites of man@@ ag@@ erial economics .
Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-@@ developed regions that will protect people &apos; s social welfare and boost purchasing power .
To that end , we must also make it our business to take more account of dem@@ and-@@ orient@@ ated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply .
Mr President , ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-@@ Irish sen@@ tim@@ ents and over@@ tones as the Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er report which we are debating today .
I would like to quote verb@@ ati@@ m from the report : &quot; State aid per capita is highest in Italy , Germany and Ireland . Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together . &quot;
I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures .
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathemati@@ cal equ@@ ation .
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus .
This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe .
Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosp@@ er .
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40 % and a top@@ -up of 15 % for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-@@ 2000 .
I remind Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea mass@@ es to reach the main@@ land European market@@ place .
No other Member State is at such a disadvantage .
Mr President , the monopolies &apos; ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe .
The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies &apos; ban to be uns@@ atis@@ factory , something I would wholeheartedly agree with .
But opinion diff@@ ers as to the solution .
The Commission &apos; s proposal does not formally devi@@ ate from the monopolies ban but the up@@ shot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation .
In other words , we are making the transition from the principle of bann@@ ing to that of mis@@ use .
Both I and other MEPs ut@@ terly reject such a dr@@ astic change of system .
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law .
We would be changing the law to make it exec@@ utable again , which is something I consider to be unacceptable .
The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemp@@ tions .
Competition restrictions are to be automatically exemp@@ ted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption , in@@ sofar as the provisions of Article 81 ( 3 ) of the Treaty on European Union allow .
The requirement to lo@@ dge applications in Brussels will be dropped ; in other words , the Commission will be completely in the dark in future .
This is unacceptable to my mind .
The Commission &apos; s programme is to be suppl@@ emented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States &apos; courts .
But if this takes place in the course of ren@@ ation@@ alisation then what we will have here is a pat@@ ch@@ work qu@@ ilt of competition policy .
This is unacceptable in my view .
It would weaken a key element of European policy .
The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contem@@ pl@@ ating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned .
There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition .
In any case , the Commission &apos; s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fif@@ ties and six@@ ties .
There was no majority for this at the time .
Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time , it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy .
For@@ ty years on , this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeu@@ vre for the monopolies , to the detriment of Europe &apos; s consumers .
I consider this to be unacceptable .
Mr President , in this important debate on competition , I am speaking this morning with particular reference to Mr Lan@@ gen &apos; s document on the Steel Aid Code .
As the Court of Justice recognised in 1996 , the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competi@@ tion-@@ related distur@@ ban@@ ces .
Indeed , several years ago , this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector .
This is why it was justi@@ fiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses , even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the EC@@ SC Treaty .
This indeed , is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code , but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious distur@@ b@@ ance of the markets , hence the importance of regulating such aid .
It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research , development , environmental protection and cases of company closure .
In the same category of ideas , it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies .
The Commission suggests shorter deadlines . I agree with this request .
Like the rapporteur , while I am pleased with the Commission report , nonetheless I depl@@ ore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid .
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way , the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipul@@ ated by the Code .
In the interests of equality , either the Code must be applied or it must be modified .
Finally , and in conclusion , Mr President , with the exp@@ iry of the EC@@ SC Treaty , the regulations will have to be reviewed since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002 , and in that case I am in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area .
We therefore await , and I await , the European Commission &apos; s proposals on this matter .
Mr President , I am also going to refer to the report by Mr Lan@@ gen , which concerns aid to the steel industry .
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues .
Firstly , I agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all Member States and , secondly , on the need for transparency with regard to this aid .
We agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that , despite the rules laid down in the sixth Steel Aid Code , the Commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that Code .
However , the thing that wor@@ ries us most , Mr President , is the decrease in prices , by 30 % , owing to imports .
The reason for this decrease is unfair competition from South Korea and Taiwan , in the case of steel , as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid .
Or@@ ders in the steel industry and the shi@@ p-@@ building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decre@@ ased dras@@ tically , resulting in a loss of jobs .
I live in a region where the shi@@ p-@@ building industry now has very serious problems : Ast@@ uri@@ as .
With global markets , we need global employment laws and global subsidies .
I know this is difficult to achieve now , but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers , here and elsewhere , and we do not secure equ@@ itable subsidies for all countries , here and elsewhere , it will be difficult to preserve jobs in Europe and outside it .
Mr President , Commissioner , Director@@ -@@ General , I would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von W@@ og@@ au report : I welcome the Commission &apos; s open-@@ minded endeav@@ ours to initiate debate on the hi@@ therto strict procedural rules , and to propose practical reform measures .
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von W@@ og@@ au , who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification , indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken , and pul@@ ls no pun@@ ches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion .
The White Paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection , discussion , and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves , the judiciary , the Member States , and above all the SMEs concerned , that need to be clarified .
Competition policy must continue to be accord@@ ed central importance and will not be ren@@ ation@@ alised because this would jeopardi@@ se the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy .
However , it must be &quot; europ@@ e@@ an@@ ised &quot; taking into account the principle of subsidiarity .
I also welcome , therefore , the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual , without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility .
In practice , only 9 cases were rejected , 94 % of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of un@@ published , non-@@ legally binding administrative communications or on account of the exp@@ iry of deadlines , which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-@@ related , staff@@ ing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement
I am in sus@@ pen@@ se as to how the discussions , which were broadly based , will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal .
The Commission report confirms that , with the exception of Germany , state aid to businesses is increasing .
The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition .
As far as we are concerned , we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes .
Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business .
Take , for example , the car manufacturing sector , where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24 % during the reference period .
With what aim ?
Not to save jobs .
All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redund@@ ancies .
Not to improve working conditions , for in increasing production with fewer workers , working conditions are made worse .
Did these firms need state aid to survive ?
No , car manufacturers have been making col@@ o@@ ss@@ al profits for years .
State aid is not only counter@@ productive because , as the Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er report acknowled@@ ges , it gives rise to subsi@@ dy hunting with firms reloc@@ ating from one country to another , but it is unacceptable because it al@@ loc@@ ates public mon@@ ies to the enrich@@ ment of a hand@@ ful of private shareholders .
It is because the rich@@ est people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced , public services are being abandoned , hospitals are being closed .
In voting against the Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er report , I wish to asser@@ t the need for another policy , to wi@@ t , c@@ easing all aid to private firms and utili@@ sing the money thereby saved to develop public services and recru@@ it staff .
Mr President , today &apos; s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerst@@ one of the internal market .
In accordance with the principle of competition , the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94 , competition policy in the strict sense , and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition .
Firstly , fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently , thanks to Commissioner Monti , there have been direct provisions , the code of good conduct in particular .
This has worked fairly well , but , as in the famous film Cas@@ ab@@ lan@@ ca &apos; time goes by &apos; and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances .
In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions .
Firstly , it is necessary , in drawing up the legislation , to produce clear and complete rules .
It is probably hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous , especially in this particular raft of legislation , that there are confused rules , regulatory vacu@@ ums and rules that only lay down un@@ defined legal concepts .
This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities .
Thirdly , it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resist@@ ing the temp@@ tation to create independent agencies which would dist@@ ort the very essence of the Commission , in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies .
Fourthly , and la@@ stly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed .
We have seen this in the abor@@ ted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world .
The principle of competition must now be universal in its application .
Mr President , Commissioner Monti , there is much that is good in Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er &apos; s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors .
First of all the report reveals Parliament &apos; s single-@@ minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions f@@ law@@ lessly .
Many of the report &apos; s conclusions , however , are cause for concern , at least for our group .
For example , the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surve@@ ys such as this .
Aid that is based on the self-@@ seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages , thus distor@@ ting competition and leading to an ineffective , un@@ economic division of Europe &apos; s me@@ ag@@ re resources .
The form the aid takes is important .
For@@ ms of state aid that require an effort from the benefici@@ ary are to be supported .
For example , state guarantees , on which the Commission has just public@@ ised its position , must naturally be considered state aid , but they are , in my opinion , a better option than granting aid directly to companies .
The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission &apos; s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency , which affects competitiveness .
The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets .
If competition policy is to be made sub@@ ordin@@ ate to the aims of social and environmental policy , real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream .
Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-@@ material rights : we should not just be emphas@@ ising its social dimension .
The aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth , not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy .
Mr Rap@@ k@@ ay &apos; s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law .
In my opinion , it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law .
A@@ im@@ ing instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we le@@ ap over the lowest hur@@ dle and end up with the lowest common den@@ omin@@ ator , which will water down all the aims of competition policy .
Mr President , Mr Monti , the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the European Union , not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years , but also with a forwar@@ d-@@ looking view to the Union &apos; s enlargement .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr von W@@ og@@ au , for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts .
Moreover , I would like to say that I appreciate the remarks and observations that Professor T@@ es@@ aur@@ o , Chairman of the Italian Competition Authority , sent me , and which I am sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration .
As things stand , there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the English , Italian and French markets . There is a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which is not found in the English market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy .
Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement , which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment .
In my opinion , we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which character@@ ise our economic structure should be placed : small and medium-sized businesses , which b@@ ind the European economy together , and social protection , which Europe has always guaranteed to the weak@@ est parts of the economy .
Saf@@ egu@@ arding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade , pure and simple , and a system for improving people &apos; s quality of life .
A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands , all of which must be protected .
We ought therefore to consider creating two foc@@ al points of an external market by ins@@ tig@@ ating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries , precisely so that their economies become less peripheral .
I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed .
Mr President , competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force .
A free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition , marked by clear , uniform rules .
In his report , Karl von W@@ og@@ au manages to capture this very well .
But Europe is changing .
The economies are growing , we are enlar@@ ging to 25-@@ 30 Member States .
The European Commission will become over@@ bur@@ dened if it pursu@@ es its current policy .
It is therefore necessary to modernis@@ e competition policy .
This is not in question .
Having said this , I still have concerns about the proposed decentr@@ alisation .
How will the Commission , as ke@@ eper of the Treaties , guarantee that decisions are taken uni@@ form@@ ly in matters of competition in London , Pal@@ ermo , Helsinki and , soon , Budapest and Ankara ?
This is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented , and issues of competition will gra@@ vit@@ ate towards the court where the most len@@ ient jud@@ gements are given .
It is not enough to say that , in the Member States , there is already 40 years &apos; worth of experience .
In the Netherlands , the competition authority is still in its inf@@ ancy .
This country has a very small market which , unfortunately , is often at the same time defined as the relevant market .
This in contrast to Germany , where a very experienced Kart@@ ell@@ amt is exerc@@ ising its powers within a gigan@@ tic market .
The European Commission &apos; s belief that , in all quarters of the Union , legislation will , almost as a matter of course , be interpreted in the same way , is what , within ca@@ tho@@ lic circles , we term &quot; fo@@ ol@@ har@@ dy , &quot; and this is not allowed .
Uni@@ formity needs to be worked on .
Th@@ ink of specialist , national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court .
This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise .
Moreover , due to the immense economic and social interests involved , we cannot afford to wait for a jud@@ gement to be pron@@ ounced two years after the event , as is now quite normal .
What is the Commissioner &apos; s opinion of this ?
I would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses .
In order to grant small and medium-sized companies greater security , the European Commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized businesses so that , alongside vertical exemp@@ tions , horizontal exemp@@ tions will also be possible .
Through cooperation , small , independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains .
It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses .
Moreover , regarding these small businesses , we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in , the yellow card , instead of an immediate red card , which will be a large fine and will threaten the company &apos; s very existence .
Mr President , being the last to speak gives me the privilege , Commissioner , of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total , and , I believe , justified , confidence in you at the hel@@ m of this boat .
But we all want to be o@@ ar@@ s@@ men on it . We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you .
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing tou@@ ches to this essential reform .
The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories .
Firstly , there is the concern that some have expressed , in particular Mrs Rand@@ zi@@ o-@@ Pla@@ th , President of the Committee on Economic Affairs , of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the Treaty .
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed .
Secondly , we have the issue of companies &apos; legal certainty .
It is true , Commissioner , that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty .
We all agree on this .
But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses , and that the Commission often plays the role of auc@@ tor@@ it@@ as , of legitim@@ ising the nature of the internal market .
On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Kar@@ as said .
There have only been nine rej@@ ections .
But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer .
How often has a lawyer with two companies and one project , in the face of a Commission gui@@ del@@ ine given ex ante , changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules !
This is therefore an aspect to be considered .
Thirdly , we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law .
In this respect , the excellent speech by Mrs Th@@ y@@ ssen cannot be improved upon .
I believe that biodiversity is good , as is cultural diversity , but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market , that is to say , competition law .
Here improvements should be made .
Only in certain countries , Germany for example , is there specialised jurisdiction .
Perhaps this is a promising aven@@ ue to explore , but we must also explore others .
Commissioner , it is impossible to over@@ state the importance of this reform .
It tran@@ sc@@ ends competition , it tran@@ sc@@ ends the cohesion of the internal market . I believe that it pro@@ found@@ ly affects the meaning of European integration , the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration .
Therefore , Commissioner , we are rel@@ ying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing tou@@ ches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I hear@@ ti@@ ly congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competi@@ tion-@@ related subjects .
In my opinion , Mr President , this joint debate fully bears this out .
We have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order .
Our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy , a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction .
The guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy , which we shall have the opportunity to address together , aims to ensure more effective protection of competition , reduce the bureaucratic burden weigh@@ ing down businesses and take decision-making processes closer to the European people .
I , personally , would sincerely like to thank Mr von W@@ og@@ au for his commitment in examining the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report .
I would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von W@@ og@@ au report into four groups . I do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the Commission , but , on the contrary , fundamental contributions , since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome .
The groups are : the efficiency of the rules , the risk of ren@@ ation@@ alisation , consistent application of the rules and legal certainty . I will take these very quickly one at a time .
Eff@@ ici@@ ency : I am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it .
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition , primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions , also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in st@@ amp@@ ing out infrin@@ gements , and la@@ stly in that it will allow victims of infrin@@ gements to have direct re@@ course to national judges , whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals .
The question of ren@@ ation@@ alisation : first of all , although it is not really necessary , I would like to point out and stress , several times if I may , that the White Paper does not affect mer@@ gers or State aid in the sligh@@ test - we are not looking for de@@ vol@@ ution in these areas - but that , as far as Regulation 17 is concerned , there is a risk of ren@@ ation@@ alisation .
Of course we have p@@ onder@@ ed this issue , and we are still studying it extremely carefully , and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voic@@ ed .
At the end of the day , I hon@@ est@@ ly do not believe that this fear is justified .
The Commission proposal acc@@ ords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy .
The reform does not ent@@ ail any reduction in the Commission &apos; s activities , but requires them to focus on the most important do@@ ssiers .
The reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term , used by Mrs Rand@@ zi@@ o-@@ Pla@@ th , and , moreover , I fully agree with it - of European competition culture .
So , the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplan@@ ted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thri@@ ve , and they are certainly not all the same .
The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned , per@@ mitting greater use of Community law , which a higher number of prot@@ agon@@ ists will be able to apply .
Allow me to emphasise that this is comm@@ uni@@ ti@@ sation , not ren@@ ation@@ alisation , of competition law .
The question of consistent application : the risk of in@@ consistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind , but I do not believe that it should be exagger@@ ated .
As with many other provisions of the Treaty , Articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 have , after all , been applied for decades by national authorities and judges , and I do not feel that this has created serious problems .
In a directly applicable exception system , consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules .
The Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework , both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice .
Secondly , we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes , and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation .
In this respect , I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Ri@@ is-@@ J@@ ø@@ r@@ gen@@ sen and Mr Hu@@ hne of monitoring implementation .
This then is the idea of monitoring implementation .
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up .
Though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on , it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts .
That is why the Commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application .
This goes at least some way towards allevi@@ ating your concerns , Mrs P@@ ei@@ js .
Conc@@ erning Mr Evans &apos; point regarding the implications for businesses , it is important that the cost-@@ benefit analysis should be seriously conducted .
The purpose of publishing the White Paper is , after all , to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources .
We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-@@ benefit assessment for business .
We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation .
There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance . This was raised by Mrs Th@@ y@@ ssen , Mrs P@@ ei@@ js and Mrs Palacio Vall@@ eler@@ sun@@ di : the issue of SMEs .
Many speakers have under@@ lined this .
The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs .
We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs .
Why ?
Is this simply a political gest@@ ure ?
No .
In the system we propose reform@@ ing our substan@@ tive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations , as in the field of vertical restra@@ ints .
Most SMEs have in fact less than 30 % of the market share .
We have a de minim@@ is notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market domin@@ ance they are not normally subject to the strict prohi@@ bition under Article 81 ( 1 ) .
We are working on further block exemp@@ tions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs , and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs , first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system , and secondly , by making Article 81 ( 3 ) directly applicable , which will benefit SMEs in particular .
The fourth group is legal certainty . Mr Evans , legal certainty is , of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses , not just for the legal profes@@ sions , although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe .
Legal certainty is important for businesses : this is a subject , the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , Mrs Palacio Vall@@ eler@@ sun@@ di , emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the wi@@ dest interest in subjects regarding the single market , including , in this case , competition .
( FR ) Mrs Th@@ y@@ ssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers .
Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pron@@ ounced a ruling on this in 1982 , as you know better than I. This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any re@@ consideration thereof .
The White Paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-@@ examined : the exchange of confidential information .
The guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion .
( IT ) I shall now quickly turn , Mr President , to Mr Rap@@ k@@ ay &apos; s report , and I would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endor@@ sement given to the Commission &apos; s XX@@ VI@@ II@@ th Annual Report on Competition Policy .
We share the same basic views but the Rap@@ k@@ ay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully .
I will mention only two , in order to be brief .
The first is greater transparency .
Parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy , as I did right from the moment I had my hearing , on 1 September , in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
As regards the international aspect of competition policy , I can confirm , Mr Rap@@ k@@ ay , that the Commission is willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject , to which Mrs Rand@@ zi@@ o-@@ Pla@@ th has also drawn our attention .
We have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant American , Canadian and Japanese authorities as regards competition policy , and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation .
Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er , I would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the s@@ eventh survey on State aid in the European Union .
I will not talk about codecision here , but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important .
It has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition ; I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion , and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference .
With regard to your suggestions , Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er , you already know that my staff , who , although short-@@ handed as usual , are fortunately highly qualified , are working hard to produce the register of State ai@@ ds and the State ai@@ ds &apos; sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard &apos; .
I am awaiting with great interest the results of the eigh@@ th survey , which , according to the scheduled tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame , should be being drawn up by the staff now , in January , and for adoption by the Commission in March 2000 , to see whether the latest trends are confirmed .
Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er , Mrs Th@@ y@@ ssen and Mr Gem@@ elli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid .
I can only say very briefly , that we are actively working with them on a practical level : they are making preparations , they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities .
I can also say , in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which , as you know , I share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental State aid .
In connection with the issue of State aid , I would also like to take up one of the points raised by Mrs Ri@@ is-@@ J@@ ø@@ r@@ gen@@ sen , among others regarding re@@ payment of illegal aid .
In April 1999 , the Commission adopted new Rules of Procedure which introduced specific rules on re@@ payment .
In the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules .
Finally , Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Lan@@ gen warmly for his report , which , although geared more towards a specific sector , is a valuable contribution .
I would like to say that , as we know , the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure , pursuant to Article 95 of the EC@@ SC Treaty , but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector .
In respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector , which will come into force in July 2002 , we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied , and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this .
When we have fin@@ alised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form , I will be happy to present our view@@ point to you .
So , Mr President , I will walk away from this debate , for which I am very grateful to Parliament , in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament &apos; s intellectual and political support , which appears to come from all sides of the House , for competition policy , its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future .
I am especially grateful for all of this . We will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs , and , at a more general level , with Parliament .
In this regard , I liked your term , Mrs Palacio Vall@@ eler@@ sun@@ di : we must all pull together , prefer@@ ably in the same direction .
Competition is not an end in itself , as Mr Rap@@ k@@ ay rightly pointed out , but it plays an extremely important role in European integration .
As Mr von W@@ og@@ au said at the start of the debate , at the end of the day competition is not an abstra@@ ct concept : it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy .
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social , as well as economic , role in the European integration process , as it has done in the past .
Thank you , Commissioner Monti .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Protection under criminal law of the Union &apos;s financial interests
The next item is the report ( A5-00@@ 02 / 2000 ) by Mrs The@@ ato , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , containing Parliament &apos; s recommendations to the Commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the Union &apos; s financial interests .
Mr President , year after year we learn , mainly from the European Court of Auditors &apos; test reports , that money is lost to the budget of the European Union on account of mis@@ de@@ mean@@ ours ranging from wast@@ age , mis@@ management , and irregularities to susp@@ ected b@@ lat@@ ant fraud .
For some time now , these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpay@@ er &apos; s money , which , when all is said and done , is what su@@ sta@@ ins the Union &apos; s budget .
Partic@@ ular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud , to det@@ ecting it , pun@@ ishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening .
Cre@@ ating UC@@ LAF by means of the T@@ ask Force and setting up the anti-@@ fraud office OLAF were important steps , as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring .
The Union can only impose sanctions in the field per@@ taining to administrative law when cases are exposed .
So far , efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for impro@@ per@@ ly obtained money to be returned only had limited success .
It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures .
Since there is often overl@@ ap between the two legal ang@@ les and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States .
Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States , together with pro@@ trac@@ ted or even un@@ fulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement .
What is more , the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this .
For it to enter into force , it must be ratified by all 15 Member States .
After five years only four have done so .
This state of dead@@ lock , which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union , has inspired Parliament to initiate the sett@@ ing-up of a European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos; s Office .
There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority , rather the aim is to equi@@ p the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests , that is whilst uph@@ ol@@ ding the principle of subsidiarity .
We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised .
The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , as artic@@ ulated in its position , together with those of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freed@@ oms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , will also be taken full account of in this process .
We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency , transparency , and the protection of the rights of individuals .
In addition , we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union &apos; s financial interests , and in which main principles are firmly established .
I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment .
The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings .
The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission , for coordinating and super@@ vising the legal investig@@ ative body OLAF .
The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency .
The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks , which are confined to in@@ quiries and criminal prosec@@ ution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union &apos; s financial interests , and to OLAF &apos; s relationship with the national authorities .
There is no question of this influ@@ encing the administration of justice in the Member States .
The Court of Justice is to monitor the leg@@ ality of the legislative acts .
In addition , we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos; s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union , where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts , the so-called cor@@ p@@ us jur@@ is , and of the feasi@@ bility studies that have subsequently appeared .
Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five W@@ ise Men .
The Commission , Mr Barnier , Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally recep@@ tive to the idea .
I call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to vote in favour of this report , which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority .
We can set another example here , to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mis@@ management and in particular , fraud , and to m@@ ete out punishment where necessary .
Mr President , I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs The@@ ato .
I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well , and the result , which we have received today , is moderate and thou@@ ghtful in a very delicate area . This moder@@ ation and thou@@ ght@@ ful@@ ness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280 ( 4 ) .
If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand , least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought .
The Treaty is a collection of complex articles . However , this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favour@@ ites to win such a prize .
At the same time , it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community &apos; s financial interests , as Mrs The@@ ato has explained very well .
We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the ste@@ ad@@ fast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community . But be careful .
The conclusions of the The@@ ato report safeguard them perfectly .
Therefore , in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , and , of course , as an MEP , I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission .
Mr President , this , as Mrs The@@ ato said , is a critical report .
It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report .
One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because , whether we like it or not , the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mis@@ management .
It is sometimes exagger@@ ated but there it is . We need to do something about it .
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been hon@@ oured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80 % of the EU budget .
A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Inter@@ ests , and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done .
We need to take this responsibility seriously .
We need to be able to prosec@@ ute people who commit fraud against the European Union .
The question is : who prosec@@ utes ?
That is where we really get into difficulty .
W@@ ho@@ se responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that cross@@ es so many fron@@ tiers ?
We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States .
The proposal to set up a European public prosec@@ utor service is a very sensitive one .
We are all aware that an all-@@ out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes preced@@ ence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people .
But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions .
Of most importance to Parliament , as the guar@@ dian of the budget of the European Union , is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions .
At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal .
People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosec@@ uted , and that is not the case at the moment .
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio .
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment del@@ eting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question .
We are aware that it is a delicate debate .
We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties .
Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a cor@@ p@@ us jur@@ is here , no commitment to a federal European public prosec@@ utor .
But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable .
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating Mrs The@@ ato on her report . I think it is a first-class report which will , for the most part , be supported by my group .
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage .
Ju@@ dging from the discussions held over the past five or six months , this could well be the case .
We all know that , in 1995 , it was agreed that the Union &apos; s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law .
But the Member States failed to cooperate .
This is just a political fact about which little can be done at present , I think .
It is now possible , on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty , that the Commission will take new initiatives , and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity .
Unlike the previous speaker , who has now disappeared , my group is strongly in favour of a European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor .
My colleague Jan@@ -K@@ ees Wi@@ eb@@ eng@@ a , will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter .
I think what we need is , at European level , to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregul@@ arity as quickly as possible .
I myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic .
One of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong , especially when it comes to revenue of the European Union , then this will be ter@@ med an irregul@@ arity in one country and a crime in another .
This , I thought , is no longer per@@ missible , certainly not at the moment .
I would like to make one general point on politics .
Whatever we may say about the European elections , the low turn@@ out is a fact .
We can improve on this by pun@@ ishing crime in Europe quickly , and this must be done at European level .
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur .
Mrs The@@ ato &apos; s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions .
I believe that is something we are all desper@@ ately in need of , bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turn@@ out .
Yet , every year we have the same problem .
The Court of Auditors publish@@ es its report , which critic@@ ises the Member States on account of various inci@@ den@@ ces of fraud .
So far , however , the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigor@@ ous action here , to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are re@@ medi@@ ed .
It is precisely this process that under@@ mines confidence every year .
I believe that Mrs The@@ ato &apos; s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpet@@ rated here .
It is important that after the first step , which has already been taken , i.e. forming OLAF from UC@@ LAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF , in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework .
We will need the European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos; s Office for this , which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees , also for susp@@ ects .
Having said all that , I must say that unfortunately , my group will not be voting for your report as a united front .
I hope that the debate will convince a few more people .
Unfortunately , however , people still have too many mis@@ gi@@ v@@ ings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that under@@ mines subsidiarity .
But I will do what I can to see that Mrs The@@ ato &apos; s report receives more support .
Mr President , we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled , even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Treaties , so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union &apos; s financial interests can be guaranteed .
The establishment of a European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos; s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doub@@ tless a good idea , but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system .
Indeed , we are talking about criminal law , the area where resistance that national States put up to comm@@ uni@@ ti@@ sation is , and will be , f@@ ier@@ ce .
Indeed , it is un@@ thin@@ k@@ able that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a European legal system .
Re@@ ading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the The@@ ato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are .
In any case , this idea must be encouraged , and it will doub@@ tless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community cor@@ p@@ us i@@ ur@@ is in the Treaties .
On behalf of my group , but also personally , I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pa@@ ve the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens &apos; rights and guarantees , which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hi@@ therto un@@ seen in many States .
Therefore , on behalf of my group , I would like to say that we support the The@@ ato report ; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda .
Mr President , Mrs The@@ ato &apos; s report on the protection of the European Union &apos; s financial interests proposes centr@@ alising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor .
This proposal is radic@@ ally opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state .
But the idea of a European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor , on the other hand , aims in the long term to con@@ fine the national states to a sub@@ ordin@@ ate role in these matters .
Moreover , this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unfor@@ es@@ een reforms .
According to the The@@ ato report , the European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor is needed , in particular , in order to better support the in@@ quiries of the anti-@@ fraud office , OLAF .
At the same time , however , we see from the van H@@ ul@@ ten report under discussion today that the European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor should in turn be super@@ vised by a European Union court .
In this way , a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one , and a medium-sized one may hide a large one .
Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigan@@ tic one , as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then , why not a European Minister of Justice , super@@ vised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament ?
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of up@@ setting if we put forward this type of reform , which appears to be quite specific .
In the final analysis , we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor demonstrate an inability to conc@@ eive of a Europe in anything other than a centr@@ alised and hierarch@@ ical form , organised around a super@@ state .
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group , on the other hand , wishes to see a poly@@ cent@@ ric Europe with nations linked in a network .
And such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosec@@ ution authorities , for example , and the creation , if necessary , of national teams speci@@ alising in offences involving Community finances .
So the legal framework , Mr President , is already in place .
It is fine , in principle . It need only be fin@@ e-@@ tun@@ ed .
Mr President , Mrs The@@ ato is proposing institutional revolution for a tw@@ o@@ fold reason .
Public opinion , although in@@ different to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad co@@ ws , is now supposed to be worried about the fraud end@@ anger@@ ing financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a tw@@ o@@ fold solution : a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or-@@ General .
Mrs The@@ ato probably for@@ got to include a European prison now that we have the F@@ B@@ I , the European police , in the form of OLAF .
All this would be established by two regulations , one for the Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor and another for the criminal code . The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty , i.e. based on secondary law , whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible .
And indeed there is a tw@@ o@@ fold shift .
Firstly , the classic Euro@@ feder@@ alist ideological shift , a single market , a single VAT , a single diplomatic service , a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosec@@ utor .
All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion , while dis@@ regarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the Gener@@ alised System of P@@ references , free trade areas , customs presents to Chi@@ qu@@ ita and the billions lost to the fourth resource , GDP , as a result of the budgetary ration@@ ing pact .
Next we have the Pur@@ it@@ an shift : the Te@@ ut@@ onic Europe of the North , the Europe of the Lu@@ ther@@ ans , Cal@@ vin@@ ists and Qu@@ ak@@ ers , wishes to inf@@ lic@@ t its moral order on us .
Basi@@ cally , the more we lose our gri@@ p on mor@@ als , the more we tigh@@ ten our gri@@ p on our wal@@ let .
Mr President , it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union , more so these days than there used to be .
The fraud and corruption sc@@ and@@ als of the past have had a pro@@ found@@ ly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe &apos; s citizens .
The credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such sc@@ and@@ als and prevent them from arising in the future .
This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes ; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affor@@ ding protection under criminal law .
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this .
Now it is , of course , possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are in@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally matters per@@ taining to the law of the Member States and it is quite un@@ thin@@ k@@ able that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity .
There is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level .
When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda , it is the call for there to be clear del@@ im@@ itation of competences that should take centre stage .
Now that is not a contradiction , since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law , as detailed in Rec@@ omm@@ end@@ ations I and II of the report , is actually about taking action in the EU &apos; s own interests , which , as far as that goes , does not damage the legal interests of the Member States ; on the contrary , it protects them , at least indirectly .
The compatibility with the various national systems of law , as confirmed by experts , shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common , for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned .
Taking these aspects into account , I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind , as proposed , and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF .
Mr President , will a European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor be able to abo@@ lish football fraud involving EU funds ?
I do not believe so .
On the other hand , we can go a long way using the existing tools .
An alternative to the European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor could be Eurojust , as proposed at the last Summit .
In the way it is structured , Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes .
It is just such practical cooperation there is a need for .
OLAF , Europol and the Treaty on Ex@@ tradition and Mut@@ ual Assi@@ stance in Criminal Mat@@ ters should be used fully and , when the Fr@@ aud Convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the Member States , we can also achieve a lot with this .
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement .
It is simply too bad , and I can well understand why people are becoming imp@@ ati@@ ent and demanding that we have a common European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos; s Office instead .
However , it would be quite a m@@ am@@ mo@@ th task to establish such an Office .
It is , after all , only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law .
N@@ in@@ ety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or in@@ competence .
Instead , there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to s@@ ack people more easily .
We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and , especially , change our practice .
At the moment , Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dis@@ miss@@ al on the grounds of gross negligence is never used .
Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we pl@@ unge into construc@@ ting grand new institutions !
Mr President , we all want to do something about combating European fraud .
But the question is now : is the European Union doing anything about it as well ?
The answer to this is that we know very little about this .
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime .
Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but , in reality , we have made little progress .
There is no European anti-@@ fraud legislation in force because the Member States , as was stated before , have not ratified the treaty texts submitted .
So a great deal has to be done in this area .
And what exactly should be done ?
Two things , and Mrs The@@ ato &apos; s report clearly sp@@ ells these out .
Firstly , the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union .
So , unification in this small area .
Secondly , we should indeed set up a European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos; s Office with two tasks , firstly to assist the national public prosec@@ ut@@ ors , helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and , secondly , to super@@ vise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision .
The European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos; s Office is nothing to be afraid of . I feel there is a lot of scar@@ em@@ on@@ gering going on .
It is , in fact , something very positive .
Just like Europol .
Europol , involving police cooperation , does not rank above the national police forces , but is there for the purpose of ex@@ changing information between police forces .
This is exactly the task which a small , limited , European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos; s Office should carry out , not just at the criminal investigation stage , but also at the prosec@@ ution stage .
Parliament supports this .
The Committee of W@@ ise Men supports this .
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same .
Mr President , I want to concentrate on the issue of cor@@ p@@ us jur@@ is .
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue .
Cor@@ p@@ us jur@@ is is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation .
The idea of a European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor on the continental inqu@@ is@@ it@@ orial model with over@@ riding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK .
The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about .
Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget .
But when cor@@ p@@ us jur@@ is was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jur@@ ists , with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time , Mr G@@ il-@@ Rob@@ les G@@ il-@@ Del@@ g@@ ado , said that he considered it embry@@ onic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity .
We need a public debate on this .
We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed .
The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed .
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date .
It is unacceptable that something like this has been fo@@ ist@@ ed on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate .
Mr President , on behalf of the Italian Radi@@ cal Members , I abstained on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control , because I share the concerns that have been voic@@ ed , in such an authorit@@ ative way , by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important : common law .
With this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue , since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be cur@@ bed , to be crus@@ hed .
Nevertheless , the way in which our committee intends to see this text through , with the drive and st@@ ub@@ born desire of its Chair , Mrs The@@ ato , will not be without its critics .
Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law .
Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pin@@ point the appropriate instruments to cur@@ b fraud .
Nevertheless , we are left feeling slightly per@@ p@@ lex@@ ed that they envis@@ age an institution which will mean higher quality , without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this . That is to say , they are negl@@ ecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosec@@ ution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system .
We wanted to express our per@@ p@@ lex@@ ity as regards these points by ab@@ sta@@ ining in committee .
Mr President , we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament , during the plenary si@@ tt@@ ings and in the committees , even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture , the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed .
We find ourselves dealing with some very serious events , which in the past seemed to be the nor@@ m .
Today , something has changed , at least in terms of mechanisms , and especially as regards monitoring , but we are still not satisfied , particularly if debates are held in competent for@@ a that go as far as to discuss a European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor , crimes , fraud , the mis@@ appropri@@ ation of funds and the disclos@@ ure of confidential information per@@ taining to one &apos; s office at European level .
I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community &apos; s interests , its image and its relationship with taxpayers , who are an indispensable and essential part of Community life .
For this reason , it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests , and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual States .
In this respect , we are faced with the most sensitive issue : what role would a European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems ?
This issue needs to be expl@@ ored further in both cultural and practical terms .
Today , we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country .
Mr President , I would very much just like to add to two particular points .
Firstly , I would not wish to take up the philosophi@@ cal issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States , although I am very much in favour of having such a debate , for my regular viewing of British television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are con@@ j@@ uring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the hom@@ e-@@ grown legal system .
Sometimes it is worthy of s@@ ati@@ re and merits discussion , but I dig@@ ress .
The point I want to make relates to Mrs The@@ ato &apos; s report .
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the European Union evi@@ dently has only very limited room for manoeu@@ vre when it comes to making these offences li@@ tig@@ able as European criminal offences - we have become em@@ bro@@ iled in leg@@ alities .
I am referring to Rec@@ omm@@ end@@ ations 1 and 2 . After all , there is no longer mention of a European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor , rather , for legal reasons it has now become an independent , European authority , or &quot; body &quot; to quote Mrs The@@ ato .
We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis .
We also face difficulties with regard to offences .
Nothing has changed there .
As has always been the case , there are offences that tran@@ sc@@ end European offences , as it were , or at least there is the potential for them to do so , and these might include mon@@ e@@ y-@@ la@@ undering , receiving st@@ olen goods , and forming a criminal organisation .
As far as that is concerned , I believe there are judicial un@@ certain@@ ties that need to be overcome .
What Parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for rec@@ ital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this dis@@ or@@ derly state of affairs .
Mr President , for years , Parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the Union &apos; s financial interests .
Fru@@ stration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention ( and of the protocols relating to this protection ) which , five years after being signed , has still not been ratified and has still not come into force .
On the other hand , more pro-@@ active attempts , such as OLAF , which is currently operating , have not all@@ ayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights .
The proposals in Mrs The@@ ato &apos; s report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substan@@ tive legislative measure on the protection , under criminal law , of our financial interests , which would crimin@@ alise certain activity , specifically fraud against the Community budget . These proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more ur@@ gent@@ ly-@@ needed uniform criminal law for the whole Community .
At the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thorou@@ gh@@ ness of investigations by OLAF , without har@@ ming the administration of justice by each Member State and under the supervision of the European Court of Justice .
Finally , following on from what was agreed in Tampere , the report rest@@ ates the need for a European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor . This issue has been brought once again to the fore by Commissioner Vitorino &apos; s timely decision to ask the IGC to include in its agenda the creation of this new role , which everyone considers vital .
We should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions , by protecting the Union &apos; s financial system with a substan@@ tive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community &apos; s economic life .
Nevertheless , it raises some very basic questions .
Is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justi@@ fying , in legal terms , the creation of a specifically Commun@@ ity-@@ wide criminal law which , although it might be called subsidiary , will always c@@ lash with the practice , and in certain areas , with the traditional , separate criminal law of the Member States ?
As there are doubts , would it not be more advis@@ able , from a political point of view , to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda , and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union &apos; s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor ?
Sur@@ ely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom , security and justice ?
Mr President , the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny .
Con@@ fi@@ dence in the European Union has been seriously damaged . To remedy this , vigor@@ ous efforts are required .
We therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any susp@@ ici@@ ons more efficiently .
At the same time , we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way .
It is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union &apos; s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States .
We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tab@@ ling proposals ent@@ ailing the further development of the already existing legal framework .
On the other hand , I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centr@@ alisation of the fight against crime .
In the present situation , I am therefore scep@@ tical about the idea of a European prosec@@ utor , which it is scar@@ c@@ ely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty .
We have more confidence in Eurojust , where prosec@@ ut@@ ors from the individual nations cooperate .
The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but , rather , that these are committed so often and far too sel@@ dom discovered .
The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is , however , to find the right mix .
The mis@@ management and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned hierarch@@ ical bureaucracy which , through an exagger@@ ated supervision of detail , prevents the development of a modern administration .
We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten &apos; s report .
The main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision .
Our experience of modern administration tells us that openness , decentr@@ alisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision .
The major challenge is , therefore , to create a modern and efficient administration without com@@ promising on supervision and the rule of law .
This requires staff training , more modern recruitment methods and , above all , openness and public control .
Being able to scrut@@ in@@ ise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities .
Mr President , rapporteur , restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the European institutions and in European politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us .
The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this .
Parliament is committed to this task , which is something this report bears impressive witness to .
On behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do , in terms of creating legal bases and eff@@ ecting institutional change , to step up the fight against fraud perpet@@ rated against the European Union .
On rati@@ fying the Amsterdam Treaty , all Member States stated that they wanted to acc@@ ord combating fraud against the financial interests of the European Union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment . Yet as things stand , only the first four Member States have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995 .
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation
A legislative act , a directive , in which there is a standardis@@ ed definition for the different types of fraud such as mon@@ e@@ y-@@ la@@ undering or cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ bility , and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective , may enable us to take a major step for@@ wards , and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due ha@@ ste .
OLAF , the European anti-@@ fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud .
Accordingly , the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks , the ECB and the EIB , cont@@ ested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations , c@@ iting their independent status .
This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting , and I hope that Parliament appro@@ ves this step .
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investig@@ ative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions .
It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF , which was set up at the same time as OLAF , to safeguard the independence of OLAF , however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investig@@ ative activities conducted by OLAF .
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point .
In other words , there is a lo@@ op@@ hole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advoc@@ ated in the report in the interests of moving things on .
There is one thing I would ask though : I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the mis@@ conception that OLAF does not now have enough authority .
No , there must be no undermining of OLAF &apos; s authority , and neither do I think this was the rapporteur &apos; s intention .
As such , I would ask you to give OLAF &apos; s work your full support , also in its present form .
Thank you , Commissioner Schre@@ yer .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.

Mr President , on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure : namely Rules 13@@ 3 ( 2 ) and 13@@ 8 ( 4 ) .
These are both about voting .
Is it not the case that on votes other than roll@@ -@@ call votes , the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then , if there is some doubt , should we utili@@ se the electronic voting system ?
That is quite right , Mr He@@ at@@ on-@@ Har@@ ris . I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call .
You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it .
In this particular case , I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on .
Mr President , I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general .
It is obvious that some pres@@ idents do not look at the hands , so to speak , but go straight to the electronic voting system .
I was wonder@@ ing whether this is the correct procedure .
I know it takes longer , but should we not always have a show of hands first ?
I shall , I assure you , Mr He@@ at@@ on-@@ Har@@ ris , pay particular attention to the show of hands .
I hope to see many hands raised when the time comes to vote .

EX@@ PL@@ AN@@ AT@@ ION@@ S OF V@@ OT@@ E@@ - O@@ wn resources
.
( FR ) The European Union is apparently financed through four own resources .
The European budget is effectively sour@@ ced from VAT and on the basis of GDP , especially now that the Community preference system has been abandoned and the multip@@ lication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural lev@@ y , which had already been cut back dras@@ tically by the Gener@@ alised System of P@@ references .
Since then , Community VAT fraud and distor@@ tions in the calculation of GDP , the tax@@ able basis for the fourth resource , have had a perc@@ ep@@ tible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources .
Since then , of course , this Europe with pre@@ tensions to feder@@ alism is now more than ever financed like the comm@@ on@@ place intergovernmental organisation it actually is , but which it ref@@ uses to see itself as .
This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us .
It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources , the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission .
Furthermore , the new Ad@@ visory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the tax@@ paying Member States .
This is a long way from off@@ sho@@ ots such as the &quot; Community criminal code &quot; , the &quot; European Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &quot; or a European police force , with OLAF .
There is as yet no federal European tax .
All the same , a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income , if not on profits , or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 20@@ 25 .
K@@ och Report ( A5-0@@ 105 / 1999 )
- ( FR ) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advis@@ ers for the transport of dangerous goods .
In recent years , the transportation of dangerous goods nation@@ ally and internationally has increased considerably , increasing the risk of accidents .
Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation .
It therefore proved necessary , in the context of establishing the internal market , to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention .
Directive 96 / 35 / EC was a response to this requirement .
Fir@@ ms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and un@@ loading operations related to such transportation have been obliged , quite rightly , to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention , whether road , rail or inland water@@ way transport is involved .
In order to facilitate achieving this objective , Directive 96 / 35 / EC provided for the appointment of safety advis@@ ers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training .
This professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation , regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport .
While this represented significant progress at the time , the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem .
It therefore seemed essential to make good this om@@ is@@ sion in order to achieve the standardis@@ ed , high-level training of safety advis@@ ers , but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training , with a con@@ comit@@ ant effect on competition between the firms of different Member S@@ ates .
The Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advis@@ ers is standardis@@ ed . It out@@ lines the minimum content of exam@@ inations and defines the role of the author@@ ising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies .
Parliament voted in favour of this text . It did , however , table a number of amendments , most of which were adopted in the Council &apos; s common position , particularly regarding the need to draw up a question@@ n@@ aire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the &apos; specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body &apos; .
In order to be realistic , I further support postp@@ oning the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force .
I shall conclude by emphas@@ ising that harmon@@ ising the professional qualifications of advis@@ ers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users , to minim@@ ising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods .
K@@ och Report ( A5-0@@ 10@@ 4 / 1999 )
Last October I expressed my views on the Hat@@ zi@@ d@@ akis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail .
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then .
Es@@ senti@@ ally , my opinion is as follows : I depl@@ ore the fact that , in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods , we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment .
I shall point out that a directive on the approxim@@ ation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997 .
This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999 .
This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derog@@ ations .
In line with the usual procedure , it is the European Committee for Stand@@ ardis@@ ation ( C@@ EN ) which puts forward standards in this area , and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carri@@ age of Dan@@ ger@@ ous G@@ oods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 ( known generally as AD@@ R ) , applicable throughout Europe , whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU .
The C@@ EN has been unable to complete its work in the time all@@ ot@@ ted . Consequently , the Commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problems , rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements , as should have been the case !
This is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail , except for the fact that a time limit had been decided .
Right now we do not have the sligh@@ test idea as to when the C@@ EN will be in a position to put forward practical proposals .
Until then , there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations .
The report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted , and grants States the option of adopting or applying alternative standards .
They may , therefore , continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation , where there are no applicable European standards .
They may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation .
In offering this explanation of my vote , therefore , I wished to express my deep dis@@ satisfaction and my deep concern .
Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter Report ( A5-0@@ 108 / 1999 )
Mr President , I wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter report with regard to regional development .
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in Europe .
Not only the difference in income per capita but , above all , large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern .
Despite the fact that the Community , through the structural funds among others , in@@ jects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in Europe , these disparities continue to exist .
I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more dr@@ astic change of t@@ ack and , based on very strict evalu@@ ations , change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively .
Mr President , in relation to the Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter report , I am aware , and have had it confirmed to me by Mr Barnier , that the rules on addi@@ tionality concerning Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transi@@ tive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self-@@ governing regions such as Wales or Scotland .
I regard that as a very uns@@ atis@@ factory state of affairs .
I hope we can re@@ visit this issue at a later time .
I want it to be clear that though I voted in favour of the report , I have this important reservation .
- The Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of EU Structural Funds in Europe for the period 2000-@@ 2006 .
I believe that this is particularly important as EU Structural Funds are always spent in a manner which maxim@@ ises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision-making process for the spending of such funds .
As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of L@@ ein@@ ster , I have always supported the need for the implementation of bot@@ tom@@ -up schemes supported by national EU funds .
I believe that the Irish Government and the European Commission and different EU governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities .
I believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision-making process for the spending of European Structural Funds .
For example , we have seen the success of the Le@@ ader I and Le@@ ader II schemes in Ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of Ireland and within Europe .
The Le@@ ader III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year .
The Le@@ ader programme at its core affor@@ ds an opportunity for public , private and voluntary groups to pool their collective tal@@ ents so as to create long-term and sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas .
This is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broad@@ est re@@ mit .
The European Peace and Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation Fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border coun@@ ties in Ireland .
Once again , there is active participation from groups from the private , public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region .
During the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-@@ 2006 , other EU initiatives such as &quot; Equ@@ al &quot; and &quot; Ur@@ ban &quot; will be operating .
These initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spent .
The rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new EU Structural Fund plans and programmes . They must promote a decentr@@ alised , efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities .
This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national , European and local funding .
.
( FR ) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy .
In order to reduce disparities between regions , of course .
But more especially because , even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy , it may also be a source of inequality .
Jacques Del@@ ors was accu@@ stom@@ ed to saying that the market was short-@@ si@@ ghted and hence the political need to reduce disparities .
It is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the European social model , which we are all in favour of , and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion .
This is a real political objective , alongside economic and monetary affairs , drawn up in collaboration with Member States , regions and local communities , with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming .
This is why I shall support this report , despite reg@@ ret@@ ting the fact that , for tim@@ etab@@ ling reasons , the European Parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist Member States , regions and local communities in the programming of Obj@@ ectives 1 , 2 and 3 .
Moreover , I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion , support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy .
Mrs Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter &apos; s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid .
It highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved , chi@@ ef@@ ly those involved at a local level , who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems , hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships , which are decentr@@ alised and involve all the agents concerned .
This is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States , which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid .
In order to do so , the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament , associations and industri@@ alists concerned by the projects and also civil society .
These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid .
Am@@ ended again as such by the Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter report , they are a step in the right direction .
They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006 , but that is another subject .
In the meantime , let us support this first step .
- This report calls for dr@@ astic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dish@@ ed out by some Member States .
Although I wholeheartedly support this aim , I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether .
In my mind , illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-@@ sponsor@@ ed social dumping .
We all oppose social dumping when perpet@@ rated by fat cat industry , we must also oppose it when perpet@@ rated by governments .
If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans , then we must have a level playing field .
Il@@ legal state aid , by contrast , destro@@ ys competitive companies and creates unemployment .
There are , of course , cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate , for example helping companies restruc@@ ture .
In all such cases , however , strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained .
Whether we are talking about beef to France or about back@@ h@@ anders to industry , EU Member States must not be allowed to fl@@ out the law .
I enthusias@@ tically support the report &apos;s proposal to publish a &quot; sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard &quot; showing the amount of state aid per Member State .
Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and sh@@ amed and their hypo@@ cris@@ y revealed .
Member States cannot be allowed to proc@@ la@@ im European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private .
I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling .
Much remains to be done , however , and I call on the Commission to be far tou@@ gher in ex@@ posing the subsi@@ dy junk@@ ies of Europe .
.
( PT ) The Commission &apos; s main instruments for over@@ coming regional disparities are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund . It is therefore crucial that the European Parliament dra@@ fts its broad indic@@ ative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity , given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective Member States .
Unfortunately , the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament &apos; s position on the programmes for 2000-@@ 2006 does not carry much weight .
It is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions , of which the Portuguese regions of the Az@@ ores and Madeira are examples . This must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion .
The truth is though , that the Commission &apos; s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives .
In the first place , if administrative procedures are not simplified , it will be hard to at@@ tain Community objectives on reform , with a view to greater efficiency and concentration .
In this respect , the Commission document has shortcomings , as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities , and for their funding , execution and monitoring .
SMEs , micro-@@ enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still &quot; weak operators &quot; , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States , including Italy , are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds .
This is why the mid-@@ term review , provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 12@@ 60 / 99 , will be of considerable importance .
In general , the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent .
They merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to veri@@ fiable objectives which are completely con@@ son@@ ant with the strategies followed in Community policies , and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement , so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clari@@ fications as regards either regional and national authorities , or candidate countries .
That said , the differing approach adopted in the guidelines , which are not geared to geographical objectives , but rather to policy areas , can be considered as positive .
While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions , we cannot help wonder@@ ing whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows , in practice , a policy of integrated interventions , for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary .
The guidelines , as adopted by the Commission , are very limited because , instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance , they are providing a shopping list of possible measures , a shopping list which , as it fails to set priorities in as@@ c@@ ending order , could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration .
We could say that , in this state of affairs , we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by r@@ ing-@@ f@@ encing ever-@@ increasing urban@@ isation and , hence the destruction of the countryside .
Rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in , by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social dis@@ integration .
A genuine f@@ law in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the or@@ chest@@ r@@ ation of coordination between the ES@@ F and employment strategy . The fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000-@@ 2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need &quot; guidelines &quot; .
I must also stress that once again the Commission is , in fact , sk@@ ir@@ ting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities .
In conclusion , the document is not particularly satisfactory , and in some aspects is disappointing .
Ber@@ end Report ( A5-0@@ 10@@ 7 / 1999 )
.
( PT ) We basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth perio@@ dic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union .
We shall therefore con@@ fine ourselves to highlighting a few issues .
Firstly , and as the Commission itself states , it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German Länder in calcul@@ ating the Community average from 1991 onwards . This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union &apos; s per capita GDP level .
We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment . This consequently im@@ poses the need for new development strategies , with a considerably greater level of attention need@@ ing to be paid to this area .
This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States , which is what the report proposes .
Finally , but no less importantly , I would like to refer to the rapporteur &apos; s proposal that , in future , this type of report should also include , amongst other issues , an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State .
The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue . This kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee correc@@ tions to regional ( and other ) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State .
. ( FR ) The Ber@@ end report gives us an interesting analysis of the situation and economic development of the regions of the European Union .
Nonetheless , the French members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group feels it cannot approve some of the statements made ther@@ ein .
Paragraph 26 , for example , &quot; Dra@@ ws attention to the special need to consolidate the budget as a prerequisite for the success of economic and monetary union and the enlargement of the Union &quot; .
At a time when , in order to fulfil the convergence criteria , Member States are forced to under@@ go a strict budgetary s@@ lim@@ ming regime , one that would be perfectly justified if they under@@ took it of their own initiative , the feder@@ alists are disp@@ laying an aston@@ ishing pec@@ uni@@ ary gl@@ utt@@ ony .
As an admission of the failure of the cohesion policy and EMU , the lack of results is put down to the lack of money , with everyone competing in el@@ o@@ qu@@ ence to demand more and more appropriations without anyone asking questions about the effectiveness of the money spent .
What can one say about a budgetary procedure which involves setting objectives for expenditure rather than a ceiling on expenditure and trying at all costs to find projects in order to spend the approved appropriations , rather than al@@ loc@@ ating the appropriations to existing projects ?
Ex@@ pen@@ di@@ ture becomes an end in itself , evidence of the success of a programme .
The statistics published by the European Commission in its sixth report do however show , as Mr Ber@@ end pointed out , the limitations of the policy being implemented :
The relative weight of the most weal@@ thy regions of the European Union was strengthened between 1986 et 1996 , t@@ esti@@ fying to a concentration of wealth , jobs and activity in certain areas : Hamburg , Brussels , Ant@@ wer@@ p , Luxembourg , the Paris region , Dar@@ m@@ stadt , Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Bremen , Vienna , Karlsruhe and Em@@ ili@@ a-@@ Romagna .
Quite the opposite of what the rapporteur stated , the establishment of economic and monetary union should exacerb@@ ate the exo@@ dus of population from the most out@@ lying , the most rural and the least populated regions in favour of the central ax@@ es of the Union ( the Ben@@ el@@ ux countries , North West Germany , Northern Italy , the Par@@ isi@@ an region , etc ) .
The poorest regions are gradually making good their under@@ development .
In 1986 , the average of the 10 poorest regions amoun@@ ted to 41 % of the overall Community GN@@ P . In 1996 it was 50 % .
Pro@@ gress is particularly marked in Portugal and Ireland .
In fact , if the rich are ever more weal@@ thy and the extremely poor are less poor , then it seems that the mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ range regions , covered by Objective 2 , are experiencing an occasionally significant down@@ turn in their GN@@ P , and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of the employment situation .
This phenomenon is particularly marked in France : the GN@@ P of the Champ@@ ag@@ ne-@@ Ar@@ den@@ nes region , which it is my honour to represent , has gone from 105 % to 94 % of the Community average , that of the Lo@@ ire region has dropped from 95 % to 91 % , and that of the Au@@ ver@@ g@@ ne from 89 % to 83 % .
This is a gener@@ alised tendency , spar@@ ing neither the Rh@@ ô@@ ne-@@ Alp@@ es , nor Al@@ s@@ ace .
It has been confirmed in Sweden and Finland , countries where unemployment has in fact increased to a worrying degree over the last few years , as in many regions of the United Kingdom .
It may therefore seem strange that , when the Structural Funds were reformed , Objective 2 , dedicated to industrial and rural areas under@@ going economic restructuring , should have been sacrific@@ ed in favour of Obj@@ ectives 1 and 3 . For the period 199@@ 9-@@ 2006 , the total appropri@@ ation for this Objective will be ECU 2@@ 2.5 billion , a figure more or less identical to that for the period 199@@ 4-@@ 1999 .
Based as it is on such choices , it is to be doub@@ ted whether regional policy can contribute to harmon@@ ious regional planning within the Member States of the European Union .

. ( FR ) Consi@@ dering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union &apos; s declared ambition to ste@@ ad@@ fast@@ ly attack unemployment , the analysis of mer@@ gers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration .
As an example I would give the restructuring of AB@@ B Al@@ s@@ th@@ om Power . A si@@ ze@@ able delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today .
The management of AB@@ B Al@@ s@@ th@@ om Power , following a mer@@ ger carried out in June 1999 , announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of lay@@ off@@ s in a number of countries .
This damaging situation for employment raises many questions , particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council , in existence since 1996 .
It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Coun@@ cils must be updated and strengthened .
It also requires the monitoring of mer@@ gers taking employment , the environment and consumers into consideration .
Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect , I abstained .
.
( PT ) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy , the Commission is de@@ vol@@ ving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion . Is@@ sues of mer@@ gers and state aid however , still remain within the notification system .
The position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy , moving towards applying Community law in national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice , and even aims at having specialised courts .
This partial ren@@ ation@@ alisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States .
On the other hand , as the rapporteur points out , in the name of competition policy , public monopolies are often ex@@ changed for private monopolies , with the privatis@@ ation of important industries and public companies , as has happened in Portugal , with harmful consequences for the country and its workers .
- ( FR ) The Commission &apos; s White Paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty ( now 81 and 82 ) certainly does not propose any &quot; ren@@ ation@@ alisation &quot; of competition policy , as some Members of the European Parliament fear .
But it does , at least , make it possible to anticip@@ ate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union .
In fact , taking note of the con@@ ges@@ tion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distor@@ tions in trade , and afraid of seeing the number of noti@@ fications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States , the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements , and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentr@@ alised fashion .
The most remarkable thing , in my view , is the message conve@@ yed by this proposal : that the Commission is anticip@@ ating the consequences of enlargement and realis@@ ing that this necessarily , and virtually automatically , requires reform of the centr@@ alised system .
Ad@@ mitt@@ edly , this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismant@@ ling .
Indeed , the White Paper envis@@ ages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system .
Moreover , the von W@@ og@@ au report , which the European Parliament has just voted on , supports it in so doing .
But at the same time , one can clearly see that the uph@@ e@@ av@@ al caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended .
It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term .
Is this not , indeed , what is so dist@@ res@@ sing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament ?
The German Social Democrats voted against the von W@@ og@@ au report because , in their view , it might break up European policy on competition , which is to say , in plain terms , att@@ acking the standardis@@ ing super@@ state .
C@@ uri@@ ously , a number of employers agreed with them , prefer@@ ring the European &quot; one-@@ stop &quot; system , which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally .
Indeed , this is one advantage of the present system .
But , on the other hand , the wider view must also be taken , namely that the initial decentr@@ alisation which has been begun today may , in the long term , lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account , and this will be of benefit to everyone .
Rap@@ k@@ ay Report ( A5-00@@ 78 / 1999 )
The Members of Parliament from the L@@ ut@@ te O@@ u@@ vri@@ ère Party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on European competition policy .
Competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other , which constantly takes the form of lay@@ off@@ s , factory clos@@ ures , not to mention extensive waste of production capacity .
We see a further example of this with the planned lay@@ off@@ s in Europe proposed by the cor@@ poration AB@@ B Al@@ s@@ th@@ om Power .
Ei@@ gh@@ teen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union , despite its being one of the weal@@ thi@@ est regions in the world : these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote .
The Commission &apos; s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market is ridicul@@ ous , for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jung@@ le where the most powerful squ@@ ash or dev@@ our the weak@@ est elements .
This is rep@@ ul@@ sive most of all in social terms .
The European Commission &apos; s report is a bl@@ unt demonstration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic war@@ fare and have no interest in the victims this causes .
There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment , nothing to protect employees , nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders ri@@ cher still !
We acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions , and still less of improving them .
- ( FR ) In voting against this report , we are acting as spo@@ kes@@ persons for all the men and women who in Seattle and throughout Europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic .
We are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services , in memory of the victims of the P@@ add@@ ington rail disaster , killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations .
This report is essentially a pri@@ mi@@ tive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jung@@ le , for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century .
Whether it is a matter of the balance of the bio@@ sphere , culture or cooperation with the third world , excessive competition is a factor increasing reg@@ ression and in@@ security .
Do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too re@@ tic@@ ent an application of this competition policy ?
We are convinced that the opposite is true , and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive .
Exc@@ essive in comparison with what iron rule , what criteria of efficiency ?
Finally , after Seattle , do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO ?
Only the legal advis@@ ers to multination@@ als could demonstrate such st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness .
Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er Report ( A5-00@@ 87 / 1999 )
I am pleased to see the quality of the s@@ eventh report on state aid within the EU , and to see that it will hen@@ ce@@ forth be an annual report , and also that the Director@@ ate-@@ General for Competition will be making information , both general and specific , publicly accessible via its website .
I am happy with the rapporteur &apos; s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this .
There is too often a tendency to critic@@ ise state aid har@@ sh@@ ly as a measure causing distortion in competition .
Ad@@ mitt@@ edly , an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union .
However , as the rapporteur pointed out , such aid is occasionally essential and may , in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm , make it possible to contribute to sustainable development ( Article 6 of the Treaty ) , services of general economic interest ( Article 16 ) and economic and social cohesion ( Article 15@@ 8 ) .
Clearly though , it must be monitored , a task which falls to the European Commission .
The aid which Union Member States al@@ locate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 199@@ 5-@@ 1997 , including 40 % allocated to the manufacturing sector .
This aid is considerably less than the previous period , 199@@ 3-@@ 1995 ( a 13 % drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.@@ 8 % to 2.@@ 6 % in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector ) .
This down@@ turn in aid is chi@@ ef@@ ly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder .
Like the rapporteur , I depl@@ ore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid .
The European Commission must make good these om@@ is@@ sions as soon as possible .
It must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time , which is to say in time for the nin@@ th report .
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register speci@@ fying the amount of state aid per Member State .
I also depl@@ ore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Ad@@ visory Committee on State Aid .
In order to compensate for this situation , the European Commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us .
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous : the matter of aid resulting in businesses reloc@@ ating from one Member State to another , with the risk of subsi@@ dy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU .
This is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment , industry and craft businesses in the benefici@@ ary countries .
Lan@@ gen Report ( A5-00@@ 73 / 1999 )
In the important debate on competition this morning , I expressed my views on Mr Lan@@ gen &apos; s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Steel Aid Code .
Just as the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996 , the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to distur@@ ban@@ ces to its competitive operation .
Establish@@ ing a system of ai@@ ds to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justi@@ fiable , even though Article 4 ( c ) , of the EC@@ SC Treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry .
This , indeed , is the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code .
At the same time , it is , of course , essential to avoid any distur@@ b@@ ance of competition conditions or of the markets , hence the importance of regulating such aid .
It is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development , environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure .
In the same way , it is vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings , as stipul@@ ated under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code .
The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-@@ month period or , at least , annually , without the need for remin@@ ders .
Like the rapporteur , I am pleased with the Commission report , but I did depl@@ ore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid .
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way , the Commission has , on a number of occasions , authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code .
In the interests of equality , there are grounds to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wishes to author@@ ise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment .
Finally , we have the problem of the consequences of the exp@@ iry of the EC@@ SC Treaty .
The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002 .
My feeling in this respect is that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code .
For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Lan@@ gen report , and I now await the Commission &apos; s response to our requests and demands .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.@@ 05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Oil s@@ lick off the French coast
The next item is the Commission statement on the oil s@@ lick off the French coast .
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission .
Mr President , I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , but also as an elected representative for Britt@@ any , and I am therefore directly concerned and sho@@ cked by these events .
Together with Mrs Gross@@ et@@ ê@@ te and the PPE-DE Group , we tabled a motion for a resolution .
I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion .
The Erika ship@@ w@@ rec@@ k is a truly European issue , firstly because it is dis@@ fig@@ uring and poll@@ uting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe , with extremely serious consequences for tourism , people who earn their living from the sea and environment@@ alists , and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale .
A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline , and why ?
Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Ex@@ x@@ on Val@@ dez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Poll@@ ution Act , which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities , as it makes it possible to hold the char@@ terer liable , and is more restrictive , and , more especially , more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and , in particular , the existence of the American coast@@ guard .
If , I repeat , we had had regulations of this type , then this disaster would surely not have occurred .
This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed , particularly the 1992 protocol which has exemp@@ ted the shi@@ pow@@ ners , in this case the oil tan@@ ker char@@ terer , from any liability .
Well , if the char@@ terer is ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated , then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for .
The regulations must therefore be reviewed , and I thank you , Commissioner , for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations .
Moreover , as you said , monitoring must above all be step@@ ped up : that of the flag state , that of the classification societies .
You told us that R@@ IN@@ A was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission .
What are the conditions for this recognition ?
What guarantees are there of its reliability ?
You are going to commission a fac@@ t-@@ finding mission .
We await the outcome with great interest .
In@@ spec@@ tions by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tigh@@ tened up .
There is a Paris Mem@@ or@@ an@@ dum in existence , let me remind you , which stipul@@ ates a minimum for inspection , that is , one in four of the vessels putting into European ports must be insp@@ ected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned .
This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries .
Why not ?
What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw ?
I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the char@@ terer is responsible for , in this case , the oil company .
If the char@@ terer &apos; s liability entails a financial commitment , then doub@@ tless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent .
Finally , we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coast@@ gu@@ ards who super@@ vise the co@@ asts of the United States .
Firstly , I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who appro@@ ached this particular problem jointly with their transport team . This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area .
Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster .
I could re@@ el off the list of disasters that have aff@@ lic@@ ted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes .
Sur@@ ely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that t@@ oo@@ th@@ less tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation , and last but not least , the oil companies and tan@@ ker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human trage@@ dies repe@@ ating themselves year after year .
How many more Eri@@ kas do we have to end@@ ure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union , not just certain areas of it ?
How much more pollution do we have to end@@ ure before the industry delivers us t@@ ank@@ ers with seg@@ reg@@ ated tanks and double holds ?
How many more se@@ ab@@ ir@@ ds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which , as our resolution points out , causes far more pollution than any Eri@@ ka-@@ type disaster ?
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal cre@@ wing standards , we are still faced with what our late colleague K@@ en Ste@@ wart used to call &apos; ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters : r@@ ust bu@@ ckets badly cre@@ w@@ ed &apos; .
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisi@@ vely .
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dra@@ gging their feet when it comes to maritime safety .
The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ru@@ ined many human livel@@ ih@@ oods . Just as the Sea Em@@ press , just as the Bra@@ er did .
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster .
My group &apos;s sympathy goes out to the people of Britt@@ any who have seen their area des@@ po@@ iled by this disaster , just as my group &apos;s sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Sh@@ et@@ land Islands on previous occasions .
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notic@@ es to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again , later on this year , discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag@@ -@@ of-@@ convenience tan@@ ker s@@ adly goes down spe@@ wing its cru@@ de oil all over the sea .
The time for resolutions has passed . What is now needed is action .
S@@ adly , I fear , the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster .
Mr President , every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again .
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea , but it is inc@@ umb@@ ent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future .
The &quot; Erika &quot; incident was serious especially for the people of Britt@@ any most closely affected , but it was devastating for the wild@@ life of much of Europe .
Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever be@@ fallen the bird life of this part of Europe .
The Royal Society for the Protection of Bir@@ ds believes that as many as 400@@ ,000 birds , perhaps mainly guil@@ lem@@ ots , may have died .
The pictures many of us will have seen of o@@ il-@@ so@@ aked birds being put down by veter@@ inary officials were both dist@@ res@@ sing and tragic .
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying .
We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the &quot; poll@@ uter pays &quot; principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced .
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks , but the question is , how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes ?
As a politi@@ cian she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year , were a similar incident , just as devastating , to take place , if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice .
The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonder@@ fully .
Mr President , Commissioner , I have brought you a small gift . Here is a c@@ ake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of No@@ ir@@ mou@@ tier who wrote to me as follows : &quot; With every ti@@ de , the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has le@@ aked out of the Erika .
With every ti@@ de , the volunte@@ ers , members of the armed forces and fire@@ men remove great p@@ anc@@ akes of this thick , sti@@ cky , black t@@ ar .
When will we see a return to clean@@ liness and the end of this devastating accident ? &quot;
Indeed this disaster involving the Erika , like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey , moreover , is unacceptable and intoler@@ able at a time when the ultimate hi@@ -@@ tech technology is available .
It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the A@@ mo@@ co Cadiz disaster , despite our saying at the time and many times since , &quot; N@@ ever again ! &quot;
It is , of course , the responsibility of policies , and therefore our responsibility , to guarantee the safety of sea transport .
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again .
But , listening to you , Commissioner , we are somewhat frustr@@ ated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992 , I believe , the Commission and Parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee .
Indeed , we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many .
This is why it is essential , as a matter of urgency , for the European Union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the car@@ goes .
We should be aware , for example , that S@@ hell and British Pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um refused to use the Erika to transport their oil .
Why , in these circumstances , is the liability of Total as char@@ terer not recognised ?
Your proposals must also include making double h@@ ul@@ ls mandatory and enfor@@ cing observ@@ ance , at last , of the ban on de@@ g@@ ass@@ ing at sea .
A European inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently .
In addition , it is also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO , as a matter of urgency .
What point is there in issuing restrictive directives if , once they are at sea , most vessels do just what they wish ?
Finally , a comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate thought for all the volunte@@ ers , nature lovers and bird lovers , who spont@@ ane@@ ously and gener@@ ously are coming through to the aid of the o@@ il-@@ covered birds , organising rescue operation with the means available .
I can t@@ esti@@ fy to this remarkable work .
You are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil s@@ lick , which is a major ecological disaster , practically unprecedented in scale .
In relation to this , you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces .
And , on this subject , Commissioner , you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habit@@ ats .
Once again , there will be no clearly defined party responsible .
In the meantime , it is nature that is taking the ra@@ p , as always .
Mr President , my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster , affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attach@@ ment to their natural environment .
Let me , in this connection , welcome the presence in the visitors &apos; gallery of Mrs Jav@@ ett@@ e-@@ Le Bes@@ que , spo@@ kes@@ person for the oil s@@ lick action group &quot; Mar@@ ée no@@ ire &quot; , made up of men and women from the French department of Mor@@ bi@@ han .
Many volunte@@ ers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field .
Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil t@@ ank@@ ers .
Among those insp@@ ected and found to be in contra@@ vention of regulations last year , 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more .
This is no longer toler@@ able .
Next , we have flags of convenience .
According to the International Transport Federation , over 40 % of the ships w@@ re@@ cked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience , the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety .
This is no longer toler@@ able .
Finally , there is the lack of transparency .
Everything is done to make the lines of responsibility , the identity of the owners and real decision-@@ makers as imp@@ en@@ etr@@ able as possible .
This is no longer toler@@ able .
In all these respects we must ensure real , significant change , including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards , including the mandatory double h@@ ull , on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States .
We must also ensure increased stric@@ tness both in issuing se@@ a-@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels .
Finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to rep@@ air@@ ing the damage caused .
I am thinking specifically of Tot@@ al-@@ Fin@@ a in the present instance .
This is an approach , Mr President , which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation .
In so doing , it will have proved its us@@ eful@@ ness to public opinion which , in this instance , is awaiting clear , tangible action .
Mr President , Commissioner , as a Member for the French Atlantic coast , for V@@ end@@ ée , I should first like to express the dis@@ g@@ ust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil s@@ lick in the face of these disasters , caused not by a natural disaster such as the hur@@ ri@@ cane which has also just struck us , but by a crime .
In this emergency , in this or@@ deal , we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity : local solidarity , national solidarity , and intergovernmental solidarity .
Quite clearly , we are now paying the price for our lack of concern .
Because our states , with the bl@@ essing of the Community , did not de@@ em it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed me@@ ticul@@ ous ship@@ building know-how to disappear , we no longer have access to the clear trac@@ e@@ ability of vessels and we can see ver@@ itable coff@@ in ships navig@@ ating our waters under flags of convenience , d@@ rif@@ ting according to the short-term interests of the multination@@ als .
It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floo@@ d@@ ti@@ de of ir@@ responsibility , irresponsible char@@ ter@@ ers , un@@ trac@@ eable shi@@ pow@@ ners and len@@ ient certification companies .
So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion .
Obviously , such matters should be handled at world level , but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose , and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determin@@ edly to make them stricter , despite previous disasters .
Ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is the International Oil Poll@@ ution Comp@@ ens@@ ation Fund , I@@ O@@ PC@@ F , but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level , which must be reviewed .
The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO .
It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this .
Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience , that of a state applying for membership of the European Union .
In addition , there are Community directives , but they are sel@@ dom applied , if at all , due to the insufficient number of national inspec@@ tors .
This om@@ is@@ sion must be re@@ medi@@ ed as a matter of urgency .
A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years , but it is making very slow progress .
The Commission is disp@@ laying intoler@@ able iner@@ tia and unacceptable shortcomings .
The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again . It is now scheduled for July .
The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict .
I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities .
Firstly , the liability of owners of oil car@@ goes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequi@@ voc@@ ally .
The best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer char@@ ter@@ ers that they will be heavily pen@@ alised in civil , criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigil@@ ant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select .
Secondly , the requirement of the double h@@ ull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off in@@ definitely .
Thirdly , a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future .
This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age .
Thus , the Erika was refused access to American waters .
If the European Community had done the same , a great disaster would have been avoided .
Let us ensure , Mr President , Commissioner , that this time we really do learn the lesson , even after the media h@@ ype and the shock of this House have died down .
Mr President , Tor@@ rey Cany@@ on , Olympic Bra@@ very , Hav@@ en , A@@ mo@@ co Cadiz , G@@ ino , T@@ ani@@ o , so many names we remember with hor@@ ror .
And now the Erika .
W@@ ho@@ se turn is next ?
Tw@@ enty one years after A@@ mo@@ co Cadiz , this ump@@ teenth oil s@@ lick , the s@@ eventh since 1967 , shows the ir@@ responsibility of our succ@@ essive rul@@ ers .
The Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react , for their capit@@ ulation to the multination@@ als .
It is hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept , and why Europe , normally so quick to pass environmental legislation , has chosen to over@@ look the matter of maritime safety .
And this is the result .
The Erika , a vessel flying a M@@ alt@@ ese flag , a flo@@ ating r@@ ust bu@@ cket , class@@ ed amongst the most dangerous type of oil t@@ ank@@ ers , has contam@@ inated more than 400 km of our coastline , a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the A@@ mo@@ co Cadiz .
As an elected representative for the Lo@@ i@@ re-@@ Atlan@@ tique region , unfortunately , I can t@@ esti@@ fy to this .
There is nothing natural about these recur@@ ring disasters , they are the result of fate .
They are the result of human thou@@ ght@@ less@@ ness .
What we have here is an ecological disaster .
Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that .
It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism , fishermen , o@@ yst@@ er farmers , sh@@ ell@@ fish farmers , people who make a living from the salt mar@@ sh@@ es , sh@@ op@@ ke@@ ep@@ ers , etc .
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series .
First of all , we must shed some light on this ship@@ w@@ rec@@ k .
Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission ?
Next , as a matter of urgency , we muss pass legislation , firstly , regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported .
In fact , according to the experts , the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to s@@ ink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast .
We know what actually happened .
Next , reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old .
We must regulate the use of flags of convenience , make double h@@ ul@@ ls mandatory for the transport of poll@@ uting or dangerous materials , work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydro@@ car@@ b@@ ons at sea .
This would be a minimum requirement , I believe , on the da@@ wn of the third millenni@@ um .
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the ED@@ D Group .
Mr President , in the course of the last few years there has been a succ@@ ession of serious tan@@ ker disasters world-@@ wide and the counter@@ measures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning .
It is particularly bad this time , not least because it has affected a major European State ; an incident which could happen again at any time .
We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks .
The 15 clearly do not suff@@ ice .
These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaus@@ tive - a minimum of 3 things . No tan@@ ker or frei@@ ghter fit only for the scra@@ p he@@ ap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again .
All those involved , including the transport agent , are responsible for any en@@ su@@ ing damage , and these individuals are to provide satisfactory ass@@ ur@@ ances .
This is the only way of affor@@ ding the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation .
However , we must aim higher in the long-term , let there be no mistake about that .
In other words , we need real cost-@@ effectiveness for our entire energy supply system .
Mr President , may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear , adequate and , at the same time , very firm response .
Many thanks for this .
This also means that , in any case , I have a great deal of respect for the brief@@ ing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today .
The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level , nature and the environment come off second-@@ best .
The damage suffered , also in ecological terms , cannot be expressed in money .
Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members .
During the Christmas break , when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster , I had a look , just out of interest , on the Internet to see what arrangements were , in fact , already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures , especially after Premier Jo@@ sp@@ in had said that Europe should do more .
What I learned is that , actually , there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision .
Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner ?
First of all , the port@@ -@@ state control , according to which 25 % of all ships require inspection .
I think that this 25 % should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place .
So this 25 % should be increased .
Furthermore , if a ship is no longer se@@ a@@ worthy , not only should the facts be examined , but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used .
But this is not in place .
Mr President , I would welcome some action in this area .
Finally , as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned , some Members have already mentioned just now that , since 1999 in the United States , ships should in any case be double-@@ h@@ ul@@ led .
In my opinion , we should look further into this point , and I also think that the Mar@@ pol Treaty , which comes into effect in 2001 , should be looked at very closely .
Mr President , I would like to take a brief , critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to , and admir@@ ation for , the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sle@@ ev@@ es in order to save animals .
Mr President , we have already had this discussion so many times in the past .
We have achieved nothing so far , and we have been unable to reach agreement within the European Union .
That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today , and what the Commissioner has announced here , actually leads to legislation being produced ; in other words , if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers : &quot; you must push this through in the Council of Ministers &quot; .
Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastro@@ phe , which also imp@@ acts on the economy and threatens livel@@ ih@@ oods .
So what are we to do now ?
I have no intention of talking about past events ; rather I want to look to the future .
What are we to do now ?
I will tell you a few things we should do .
Of course , we need double-@@ h@@ ul@@ led vessels .
That goes without saying , but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term .
So what do we need to happen immediately ?
We need technical testing of ships , that is obligatory technical testing every two years , and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate .
We need this at European level and internationally ; we need something like a T@@ Ü@@ V , an organisation that under@@ takes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany , which is compulsory every two years .
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle .
This is what we need for ships .
Thirdly , we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports , that is in every port of the European Union .
Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port , regardless of all the port charges .
We must reach agreement here , in all the European Union &apos; s ports , from Mar@@ sei@@ ll@@ es , through to Rotterdam , to Wilhel@@ m@@ sha@@ ven , Cu@@ x@@ haven , and wherever ships drop anch@@ or .
Fourthly , we need the shi@@ pow@@ ner to bear liability , and not just to the tune of a der@@ is@@ ory USD 12 million , but to the value of at least USD 400 million , to be covered per insurance certificate .
We also need the country whose flag the ship fli@@ es to bear liability .
We need to be sure that if need be , the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability .
This would be a marvell@@ ous exercise in supervision !
I can assure you that those countries awar@@ ding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability .
In the fifth place , we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and water@@ ways of the European Union , and inci@@ dentally , that includes the candidate countries .
Last but not least , we need a long memory , for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future .
Environmental standards will be a recur@@ ring theme .
I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports .
The unions will have something to say as will industry .
A long memory will serve us well , ladies and gentlemen .
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the for@@ efront of the environmental movement .
Just you go home and say : &quot; we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date &quot; .
We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports .
We need to have a long memory when we say : &quot; for once we are united , at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned , and will not play one off against the other in the European Union . &quot;
If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years &apos; time !
Mr President , Mrs Roth@@ -B@@ ehr@@ endt expressed very many of my own thoughts .
We have now obtained a first-@@ rate en@@ um@@ er@@ ation of a variety of measures .
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led ?
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation &apos; s introduction of the P@@ lim@@ soll line , a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inf@@ erior vessels .
Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had ?
I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth@@ -B@@ ehr@@ endt speaks about , the identification in the form of green marks on t@@ ank@@ ers which certain har@@ bo@@ urs in Europe have brought up for discussion .
We must also cri@@ tically examine the classification societies . I do not think that we can accept their procedures .
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control .
Finally , I want to say that , when my country provides environmental aid to shi@@ pow@@ ners who wish to improve the quality of the environment , there are units within the Commission who regard this as prohibited aid to ship@@ yards .
Within the Commission , the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing .
It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment , which are in keeping with the Commission &apos; s guidelines , cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to ship@@ yards .
Mr President , we shall vote in favour of the GUE / NGL Group resolution because it den@@ oun@@ ces Tot@@ al-@@ Fin@@ a &apos; s responsibility in this ecological disaster and I endorse the proposal that flags of convenience and the use of super@@ ann@@ u@@ ated vessels should be prohibited , or that double h@@ ul@@ ls should be mandatory for oil t@@ ank@@ ers .
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil s@@ lick .
How can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute dra@@ con@@ ian measures against the major oil corporations , and indeed many others who , in order to make more profit , take the risk of making the world un@@ inhab@@ itable ?
How is it possible not to be ou@@ tra@@ ged when a bank ref@@ uses to di@@ vul@@ ge the names of the Erika &apos; s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality , without governments re@@ acting ?
The cru@@ x of the problem is that all governments , and indeed all the European institutions , acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Tot@@ al-@@ Fin@@ a and its il@@ k to maxim@@ ise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment .
They accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks , even though this same confidentiality serves to conc@@ eal what are essentially criminal actions .
In these circumstances , even the best resolutions will remain little more than appe@@ als to principle which are power@@ less to limit the great corporations &apos; capacity to cause damage .
Mr President , I am in favour of tigh@@ tening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies .
However , we must stick to the facts .
The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years .
The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rig@@ our with which the controls are undertaken .
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls .
I cannot accept this .
If the Member States decide , in agreement with ourselves , that 25 % of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control , then they must also make the necessary personnel available .
The controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspec@@ tor does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire ext@@ ingu@@ ish@@ ers missing , rather there must be materials testing , for this ship obviously broke up on account of material f@@ ati@@ gue .
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous .
It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not super@@ ficial , but include materials testing .
Secondly , I also share the Commissioner &apos; s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path .
If it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of fav@@ ours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies .
That is the only det@@ err@@ ent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit .
Mrs Roth@@ -B@@ ehr@@ endt , we already have a T@@ Ü@@ V ( organisation for safety testing ) for ships in the form of the classification companies .
There are rep@@ utable companies too .
You will be familiar with some rep@@ utable companies , our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some rep@@ utable companies , but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements , and these must be struck off the list .
Finally , we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it acc@@ edes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfil@@ s our requirements , for the environment is a commun@@ al entity and not something that we can divide up !
Mr President , I welcome the statement from the Commissioner .
Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea &apos;s power and destructive force , which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential .
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sin@@ king of the oil tan@@ ker Erika .
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a depl@@ or@@ able waste of resources .
It should be noted that the oil industry , through the International Oil Poll@@ ution Comp@@ ens@@ ation Funds , regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol , for over 90 % of the estimated cost of this incident , or some USD 170 million .
This suggests to me that we should also look to the shi@@ pow@@ ners , to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility .
However , before we r@@ ush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations , let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented .
Better to he@@ ed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embar@@ k on new proposals .
In that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection .
I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels &apos; structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions .
C@@ alls for design improvements in h@@ ull construction , especially double-@@ h@@ ul@@ led vessels , are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet .
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection .
Mr President , I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues , mainly in the committees on transport and the environment , who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry .
Because , as well as the irre@@ par@@ able damage to the environment , the damage to the eco@@ system and losses in the tourist industry , the oil s@@ lick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry , to the conservation of marine resources , and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover .
It is no accident , Commissioner , that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed , those which e@@ ke out a me@@ ag@@ re existence from tourism and fishing and which , in the majority of cases , do not have any other resources .
These are the same areas , Commissioner , which already have to put up with the dis@@ resp@@ ect@@ ful activities of certain shi@@ pow@@ ners who empty the bil@@ ges of their vessels off their co@@ asts , without any control whatsoever .
I come from a region , Galici@@ a , which has suffered similar accidents in the past .
Britt@@ any and Galici@@ a , two European &apos; Land@@ s En@@ ds &apos; , fall constant pre@@ y to the ir@@ responsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport cru@@ de oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil sli@@ cks .
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways .
On the one hand , by asking the Commission , within the scope of aid to the fishing industry , to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastro@@ phe on the industry in the areas affected , and also by asking them to demand , of international bodies and of themselves , tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience .
In this regard , the current process of negotiations on Malta &apos; s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigor@@ ously monit@@ ors the oil t@@ ank@@ ers which sail under its flag .
On the other hand , prevention is essential .
Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea .
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level , using all the means at our disposal - technological , structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future .
Lastly , Mr President , I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunte@@ ers and local authorities , who reminded me of old times when , as the then May@@ or@@ ess , I lived through similar situations .
We must thank those who , while defen@@ cel@@ ess and lacking in resources , have batt@@ led courage@@ ously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions , the marine eco@@ system and European fishing stocks .
Mr President , as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I should like to congratulate the Commission , and in particular Commissioner Loy@@ ola de Palacio , for her reaction to this incident , which has really sha@@ ken the whole of Europe .
We , as the Committee on Transport , are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and , of course , we are likewise prepared to discuss , at a later date , the legal implications of this communication .
In addition , I should like to make a number of comments :
First , the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of R@@ IN@@ A , the Italian shipping register , because we need to know if Community law was applied .
That should be the starting point for our efforts .
Secondly , apart from the shi@@ pow@@ ners &apos; liability , it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the char@@ ter@@ ers , for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and , of course , for restoring the damage .
Once we have done that , our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified .
However , this should not lead us to acc@@ use the whole mer@@ ch@@ ant marine , which is an important sector of the economy , covering as it does 1 / 3 of transport requirements , which is why our reaction needs to be measured : strict , but correct .
I have no obj@@ ection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but , as other members have stressed , we need to start with application , because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact .
This legal framework is fairly advanced , at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States , under the supervision of the Commission , should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied .
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that the unfortunate incident involving the Erika should in fact , as others have said this afternoon , constitute a decisive water@@ shed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where , since 1967 , there have been s@@ event@@ een accidents involving large oil t@@ ank@@ ers ; more than one every two years .
The economic and social damage , which we have spoken about today , in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources , is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions .
Commissioner , I would also like to thank you for the spe@@ edy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented .
I trust that these measures will , in a few months , give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive , possibly - which will put an end , once and for all , to these 21st Century pir@@ ates , who depri@@ ve us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea .
I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken , which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues .
I am referring to the double h@@ ull , which consists of two layers of steel , with containers divided into two tanks .
Commissioner , there are many experts who consider that the double h@@ ull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called &apos; ecological h@@ ull &apos; in which case , in the event of an accident , the se@@ a@@ water pen@@ et@@ rates the containers and , as a result of pressure , the oil is transferred to other tanks .
Commissioner , I believe that it is time to opt for the saf@@ est technically possible measures .
It is therefore not sufficient to merely re@@ produce the legislation in force in other countries .
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard .
Any cost-@@ benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occa@@ sion@@ ed to persons and the environment by these accidents , is bound to support this approach .
Mr President , Commissioner , I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us , after each of our respective political groups has r@@ alli@@ ed together and expressed its feelings , finally to produce a joint resolution .
I think that given the dramatic circumstances , and as a matter of principle , it would be ill-@@ advised and inappropriate to hold several votes .
On the other hand , Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote , for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preced@@ ed me . I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or ev@@ a@@ sions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area .
I think that it is quite obvious , and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster , that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport .
Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area , common air@@ space , a common rail area and a single market , but not a common maritime area .
I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms .
The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation , in which we can set standards .
I have also noted , to my great satisfaction , that even the groups advoc@@ ating greater national sovereignty , or the eur@@ o@@ scep@@ tic groups are calling for Europe to regulate , and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action .
We sometimes regulate things which could , by and large , remain subsidiary .
In this area we must respond to public opinion .
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are , when all is said and done , on the global scale merely a peninsula .
Therefore , once our legislation has been brought into line , we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law .
We must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the &apos; poll@@ uter pays &apos; principle of responsibility which is , of course , supposed to be a det@@ err@@ ent .
I have almost finished and I would like to say that I have personally requested a public hearing of the Committee on Transport , which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future considerations .
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing .
Mr President , the oil tan@@ ker Erika , the ownership of which is vei@@ led by accommodation addresses on Malta and probably in Italy and Greece and which was hi@@ red by Tot@@ al-@@ Fin@@ a for the transport of oil , fo@@ under@@ ed off the Bre@@ ton coastline , with disastrous consequences .
The implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment are enormous .
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weak@@ ened structure of the oil tan@@ ker .
So people are doub@@ t@@ ful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or poll@@ uting goods .
The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection .
States can carry out port inspections .
In Europe , legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to insp@@ ect 25 % of the incoming vessels according to the port@@ -@@ state control directive .
However , it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspec@@ tors .
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation .
In my opinion , the Commissioner is quite right .
Where the scheme fal@@ ters is in the enforcement of existing legislation .
But how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspec@@ tors , est@@ e@@ emed European Commission ?
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93 / 75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or poll@@ uting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States ?
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored ?
Would it not be beneficial , in the short term , following the Rotterdam model , to insp@@ ect according to a points system in which , for example , account is taken of the ship &apos; s age , whether it is single or double-@@ h@@ ul@@ led or whether it sa@@ ils under a flag of convenience .
In short , to give priority to older sub-@@ standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements .
The Erika was built at a Japanese ship@@ yard and is single-@@ h@@ ul@@ led .
There are four more sister ships in service at present .
Con@@ struction of this type of ship was hal@@ ted at the time because the risk of ru@@ sting was especially high .
Some of them also sail under the M@@ alt@@ ese flag .
Are we waiting for the next accident to happen ?
Would sanctions not be appropriate , as the Commissioner stated , for the classification society ?
R@@ IN@@ A is currently the talk of the town .
Malta is entering the accession negotiations .
In my opinion , the European Union can only accept Malta if it is guaranteed that the M@@ alt@@ ese flag will sail without an accident in future .
I would be grateful if you could be discipl@@ ined since we are running out of time , and this delay is going to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission .
Mr President , just before I went down into the Chamber , I received an e-mail with a quite emotional description from a Swedish woman who had chosen to spend New Year &apos; s E@@ ve on the French coast in Britt@@ any instead of staying at home and celebr@@ ating with her relatives .
Like many other hundreds of volunte@@ ers , she had seen the destruction , wash@@ ed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there .
Like so many others , I too wonder where the people responsible are .
Where are the shi@@ pow@@ ners and those who order the ship@@ ments when these disasters occur ?
Perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime .
This is not the first time we have seen oil sli@@ cks , whether inten@@ tional or un@@ inten@@ tional .
( The President cut the speaker off )
I would like to thank Mrs Gross@@ et@@ ê@@ te and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament .
The environmental disaster of the sin@@ king of the Erika off Britt@@ any and the sp@@ il@@ lage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media .
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently , I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected .
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wild@@ life , in particular birds and the already d@@ wind@@ ling fish stocks , have brought back memories of similar British disasters , such as the Tor@@ rey Cany@@ on in 1967 , and have promp@@ ted many British volunte@@ ers to help .
I s@@ alu@@ te these joint efforts to repair the damage .
This is clearly a problem for all EU coast@@ lines which will require imagin@@ ative solutions .
Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as L@@ loy@@ ds of London , we must develop new technologies to retri@@ eve from the sea much more than 10 % of the lost oil .
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market pic@@ ks up the tab .
Ultim@@ ately , the poll@@ uter must pay .
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25 % of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered .
Moreover , although I am not opposed to shi@@ pow@@ ners regi@@ stering their vessels in their country of choice , I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations .
Rather than bann@@ ing flags of convenience , which would viol@@ ate the right of every sovereign state to have a mer@@ ch@@ ant fleet , under the 1995 EU directive on port state control , national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations .
I sincerely hope that , particularly during the French presidency later this year , the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options , and I hear@@ ti@@ ly commend this resolution to Parliament .
Mr President , it feels quite strange to be standing here again today , as I have been doing at regular inter@@ vals for almost ten years , and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence , and not by force ma@@ je@@ ure .
The victims are waiting outside .
They want answers .
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep , or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through .
The citizens are right to ask : &quot; do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever ? &quot;
Who will provide us with new jobs ?
When will those responsible at last understand that spar@@ ing resources is not something we do for fun ; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group , rather it is a joint European challenge .
That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio &apos; s action plan with open arms .
It is equally important to note that &quot; prevention is better than cure &quot; .
But there is an art to that as well .
Dep@@ lo@@ ying the German multi@@ purpose ship &quot; Neu@@ werk &quot; - it is right outside my front door in Cu@@ x@@ haven - ent@@ ailed the swi@@ ft provision of European neigh@@ bour@@ ly help .
We are particularly in the debt of those who under@@ took the difficult deployment of all their crew .
Valu@@ able experiences were gained , and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone .
We are therefore right to demand improved controls , sanctions and preventive measures .
I have been fighting for a European environmental coast@@ guard service for almost ten years , here in Parliament .
The issue is as topical as it was before .
Furthermore , I will not with@@ hold my support but will endeavour , alongside my fellow MEPs , to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation .
Before the end of March , I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts , that is to say , amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament .
I would like to tell you that , in fact , it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem . There are men and women who depend on fishing , gathering sh@@ ell@@ fish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas .
They are environmentally sensitive areas , but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um . And therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of a similar situation .
Mrs Roth@@ -B@@ ehr@@ endt said that nothing had ever been done .
In fact , I believe that things have been done by the Commission , but there is still more to do .
This was demonstrated by the Americans who , after the Ex@@ x@@ on Val@@ dez disaster , within one year , adopted enorm@@ ously rigorous and tough legislation , which threatens , as I said earlier , to diver@@ t ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe .
In Europe , after the A@@ mo@@ co Cadiz , or the Ur@@ qui@@ ola on the Spanish coast , in 1976 , or the Tor@@ rey Cany@@ on , in the same year , or the many other cases there have been , we really began to legisl@@ ate after 1994 and 1995 , particularly in the last few years .
During these years , the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport .
That is the reality .
In my opinion , we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems , also deri@@ ving from American legislation , which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector .
I have referred to a series of issues which I will lay out in more detail , if you wish , in an appearance before a special committee on this matter , or when I present the actual initiatives in the coming months .
My intention is - and I insist - for us to begin discussions after the end of March , also coinci@@ ding with the Council of Ministers , and , of course , before the end of the six-@@ month period of the Portuguese Presidency , for us to have texts to discuss .
Fl@@ ags of convenience are one problem , but are not the only one .
The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but , nevertheless , that country has an extremely high number of inci@@ den@@ ces at inspections ; more than the countries with flags of convenience .
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community .
We must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end .
This will ob@@ lige us to re@@ consider the regi@@ sters in the European Union , and to deal with the not@@ orious problem , which will no doubt arise again , of the aim of a Community register .
I believe that this will be difficult but , in any event , we should carry out a review of the regi@@ sters of the European Union countries .
As for the inspections , very much a key question , the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked , as Mr Hat@@ zi@@ d@@ akis has said .
We already have legislation .
According to the information which the Commission services have given me , this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel , means and inspec@@ tors .
The problem is not that only 25 % are insp@@ ected , but rather how we select , how we find , the ships which constitute the highest risk , through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags .
Unfortunately , the 25 % often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements : in this way inspections are qu@@ icker and the work is carried out more easily .
Therefore , more than making amendments , we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done , apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews , especially in relation to the age of the different vessels .
And that is why we have SO@@ LA@@ S ( the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ) and MAR@@ PO@@ L ( the International Convention for the Pre@@ vention of Poll@@ ution from Shi@@ ps ) , two conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitored .
With regard to the question of Union inspec@@ tors , I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justi@@ fies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States , which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately .
Lastly , I would like to stress the issue of liability .
Not only in terms of maximum sums ins@@ ured , which I believe should be similar to those in the United States .
We have set a figure of USD 180 million ; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments .
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States , but that we also have to re@@ consider the sums ins@@ ured on vessels and , therefore , the liability of shi@@ pow@@ ners , and also to hold liable those who charter ships , which is to say the owners of the cargo .
Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable , we will never , in my opinion , resolve these problems .
I will end now . I will not expand further .
We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions .
But , obviously , as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where , within one , two or three years , we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done .
As for me , I can say , after having debated it in the College of Commissioners , that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures , amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council , in order to equi@@ p ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety .
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
We have taken good note of your intentions .
I have received 8 motions for resolution , in accordance with Rule 37 ( 2 ) , to close the present Commission statement .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.
Stor@@ ms in Europe
The next item is the Commission statement on the stor@@ ms in Europe .
Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
Commissioner , I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward , particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union , in terms of the help that we can offer them .
In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to re@@ draw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas dev@@ ast@@ ated by the stor@@ ms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2 .
I think that you must have done so , because you have not mentioned it .
In fact , we all know that anyone who does not live within the per@@ im@@ eter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid .
We should therefore put this situation right immediately .
You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem , but also a medium and long-term one .
Let me explain .
I was in the region of Lor@@ ra@@ ine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20 % of deci@@ du@@ ous forest .
Indeed , for some &apos; forestry &apos; districts , which have lost 20 % of their trees , this represents a huge loss .
We know , for example , that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach mat@@ urity , so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one , two or five years , but over many more .
The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years .
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues .
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies .
It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one .
Indeed , you spoke of rel@@ easing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not de@@ preci@@ ate .
On the other hand , districts which have not been affected by the stor@@ ms will also suffer , as the National For@@ est@@ ry Office has decided to free@@ ze cuts in forest@@ ation for four years .
Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case .
I am telling you all of this to illustr@@ ate how complex the problem is , and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could .
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that , although there has indeed been an economic disaster , the real ecological catastro@@ ph@@ es are still to come .
As you yourself said , Commissioner , these disasters or stor@@ ms do not always have natural causes , and we think that these are the first signs of climate change .
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact .
Mr President , everyone who has trav@@ elled here by car , train or aer@@ op@@ lan@@ e , has been able to see the extent of the damage , particularly in France , caused by hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of a completely unprecedented violence which struck Europe at the end of last month .
What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster ?
Firstly , I would like to pay tribute to the may@@ ors and local representatives who , on a daily basis , have had to re@@ assure their constitu@@ ents , organise volunte@@ ers and cooperate with the public services .
They have earned the confidence of their fel@@ low-@@ citizens .
Next , I would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the Union &apos; s Member States who , in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation , came to support the efforts of their French colleagues .
I would also like to consider the paradox@@ ical situation we have with regard to emergency aid .
If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey , we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims , but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so .
We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly .
I am thinking in particular here of fish and sh@@ ell@@ fish companies , which have been particularly badly hit .
As you said , Commissioner , we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced c@@ ess@@ ation in activity and that appe@@ als can be made to F@@ IF@@ G for investments that have been totally wi@@ ped out .
Beyond this , I think that implementing MA@@ G@@ Ps in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected .
I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and , on the contrary , to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments , which they urgently need .
Mr President , the stor@@ ms which dev@@ ast@@ ated France during the night between 26 and 27 December have caused , as has been said , 90 deaths and damage to a value of FF 75 billion , i.e. EUR 11 billion .
Almost three weeks after the disaster , several thousand people were still without electricity and teleph@@ ones , 500 000 hectares of forestry land , or 100 million c@@ ub@@ ic metres of forest , have been ru@@ ined , and our historical heritage has also been affected , as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Ver@@ sail@@ les demonstrates .
It seems quite natural that given such a disaster , national and European solidarity should go to the help of the dev@@ ast@@ ated regions and those people who have been worst affected .
We know full well that what you are doing , Commissioner , and that is , limiting yourself to giving us the hypo@@ the@@ tical and remote possibility of benef@@ iting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the pro@@ visi@@ onal Obj@@ ectives 2 or 5@@ b .
These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Mart@@ ine@@ z on 11 January 2000 .
I can show you a copy if you wish .
We would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission , but also of this Parliament , and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so .
But for pity &apos; s sake , and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way , please do not present appropriations which have previously been ear@@ marked under an un@@ related regional policy as aid for victims of the stor@@ ms .
As a matter of urgency , therefore , we must restore , within the framework of a supplementary budget , the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters .
We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union . That , however , is another problem altogether .
Mr President , Commissioner , Europe has under@@ gone a tough or@@ deal at the start of this millenni@@ um .
I would first like to express my hear@@ t@@ felt con@@ dol@@ ences to the families in mo@@ ur@@ ning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that dev@@ ast@@ ated Europe in December .
These stor@@ ms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests .
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region , Lor@@ ra@@ ine , which have suffered enormous destruction .
I would like to congratulate the regional authorities , the volunte@@ ers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they r@@ alli@@ ed round but , unfortunately , their troub@@ les are not yet over .
It is Europe &apos;s duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster .
I welcome Mr Barnier &apos; s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced .
I am certainly not for@@ getting the economic dimension of this matter , as the timber industry has been dev@@ ast@@ ated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this .
The Community action programme for civil protection , established by a Council decision on 9 December , was launched on 1 January 2000 .
I ask Member States to gr@@ asp this opportunity . This programme must work at full capacity .
Although it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the sinc@@ erity of Commissioner Barnier &apos; s words - unfortunately it is still in its inf@@ ancy when it comes to forestry .
Our priority , as we wait for Commun@@ ity-@@ level funds to be fre@@ ed up , is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States .
It is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads , and to repair them as quickly as possible .
L@@ ending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure .
Our next challenge will be to prevent the occurr@@ ence of ph@@ y@@ to@@ sanit@@ ary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest , and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood .
Finally , it is essential that we slow down the log@@ ging of standing wood , in order to give priority to the purchase of wind@@ falls .
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States .
This aid for gathering timber is , of course , only the first stage of an aid package , which will take the form of aid for re@@ forest@@ ation and aid for the development of rural areas .
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over .
This is a very sad opportunity for Europe to rene@@ w its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wild@@ life and nature conservation and in our economies .
It is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic cal@@ am@@ ity .
If this solidarity is to have been worthwhile , it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry .
Hur@@ ri@@ cane &quot; L@@ oth@@ ar &quot; should prompt us not to ab@@ ide solely by the principle of undertaking rep@@ airs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very super@@ ficial level here - , but to switch to the precautionary principle , under the terms of which potential perpet@@ r@@ ators are brought to book too .
Cur@@ rent programmes must be acceler@@ ated .
For example , as they stand , the Commission &apos; s programmes will prec@@ lu@@ de us from meeting our obligations under Kyoto .
The trade in emissions rights is im@@ moral to my mind and rather than solving the problem , it shel@@ ves it .
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term .
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipul@@ ated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources , as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases .
The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject , and what it has put forward is wo@@ efully inadequate !
Commissioner , Mr President , L@@ oth@@ ar was a quite ordinary name hi@@ therto .
However , it has now achieved not@@ ori@@ ety .
The hur@@ ri@@ cane of the same name sw@@ ept across Europe claiming numerous victims , mainly in France and Germany , but also in Switzerland , leaving a trail of destruction in its wake .
The wind tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed over electricity p@@ yl@@ ons , ro@@ ofs , traffic signs and , ultimately over the forest .
We have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million c@@ ub@@ ic metres of solid timber , and this is only an estimate .
I have listened to you very atten@@ tively Commissioner , and welcome with open arms the fact that you are int@@ ending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastro@@ phe has had in France and in Germany .
If Mrs Schre@@ yer is to visit the Black Forest some@@ time in the next few days , then any one far@@ mer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual .
What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region , or in a 5@@ b region ?
What answer will the Commission give , when it is on the scene , when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam@@ -@@ building , and we want to re@@ build our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc . ?
All this is well-@@ inten@@ tioned advice .
However , I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predomin@@ ates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage .
The th@@ inn@@ ing-@@ out we need is not being attended to ; the forests are not being t@@ ended to the requ@@ isite degree .
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid , so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date .
Mr President , Commissioner , permit me , first of all , to make reference to two facts .
Firstly , at the beginning of 1999 , NATO , with the participation of most Member States of the European Union , flat@@ tened Kosovo with bom@@ bs in the name of freedom .
We are now endeav@@ our@@ ing , at huge cost , to get the country back on its feet again and help its people , and rightly so .
Secondly , at the end of 1999 un@@ believ@@ able stor@@ ms ra@@ ged bringing death and destruction to vast trac@@ ts of the EU .
The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims &apos; cri@@ es for help with a shr@@ ug@@ ging of shoul@@ ders .
&quot; We do not have the wher@@ e@@ with@@ al for that , &quot; they said .
This is wrong !
And no one can compreh@@ end this attitude .
Certainly those who fear for their livel@@ ihood are at a complete loss .
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity , also from within this Community .
I say they have a right to solidarity .
Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need .
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the stor@@ ms .
It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority .
I call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wher@@ e@@ with@@ al for providing aid as the good will .
Per@@ mit me one further comment . Although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm , the tan@@ ker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter .
The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency .
We can no longer toler@@ ate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal mach@@ inations .
We must make the perpet@@ r@@ ators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment .
Then , for example , people will think twice before transpor@@ ting oil in a tan@@ ker that is about to fall apart .
When , in 1994 , over five years ago that is , I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament , I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier .
To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission , which will actually enable me to start work .
It is a sc@@ andal@@ ous state of affairs that must be ended with all ha@@ ste , and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again !
Mr President , Commissioner , the stor@@ ms that took place at the turn of the millenni@@ um should gal@@ van@@ ise us into thinking about certain problems .
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters .
There have always been natural disasters and there always will be .
Of course , there is a need for solidarity here .
There is certainly a need for European civil protection , and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters .
But , most importantly , it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the natur@@ e-@@ mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature , for nature cannot make mistakes .
The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density , the type of infrastructure , and , of course , the many mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ es , if we are talking forests .
Of course , I am in favour of providing assistance where we can .
But when it comes to aid , we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future , more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cab@@ ling underground .
We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed wood@@ land when undertaking re@@ forest@@ ation , rather than mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ es .
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate .
To this day , we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream , and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff .
America and south-@@ east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and stor@@ ms go .
We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream .
But in common with others , we too are having to end@@ ure the greenhouse effect .
This is partly the work of human hand , as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations .
We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference .
We must reduce CO2 emissions , employ renewable energies , and generally make en@@ quiries , in this connection , as to how the forests of Europe are far@@ ing .
Mr President , I think we should firstly express our sor@@ row for the victims .
This is an irre@@ par@@ able loss .
Secondly , we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens , and the solidarity of other countries with France , which is the country worst affected .
As I have little time , Mr President , I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution .
I believe that the first one was implic@@ itly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wonder@@ ed whether these catastro@@ ph@@ es are natural or not .
That is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities , in general terms , are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years .
In fact , over the last decade , the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century .
Therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals .
Secondly , I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner &apos; s proposal to create a European civil protection body .
Furthermore , we should utili@@ se an extraordinary budget line , since this is an extra@@ ordin@@ arily catastro@@ phi@@ c situation .
First of all , we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy .
It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards .
It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this .
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have trage@@ dies like this .
That is important .
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past . It was very small .
It was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly ab@@ used by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major .
Offici@@ als and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels , wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constitu@@ encies .
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished .
I think we should re@@ inst@@ ate this budget line .
When we had the earthquake in Greece , which was a big disaster , the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Gre@@ eks .
The same when the floods came in France and the same again now .
These are major disasters , we should have an instrument , we do not have it .
We should re@@ inst@@ ate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument .
We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it .
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind stor@@ ms on the Atlantic .
We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these .
Ladies and gentlemen , none of us must forget what has taken place .
It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to dis@@ continue emergency lines .
It is also true that there is a lot of European money around . Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that o@@ yst@@ er farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development , forestry would be eligible under Article 33 , companies would be eligible under exemp@@ tions from the competition law stated in Article 87 ( 2 ) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds .
It is nevertheless the case that not a p@@ enny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be fre@@ ed up to demonstrate practical , active solidarity .
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul .
This is inadequate , and I am personally delighted that Mr Barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which , moreover , I expressed when I told the press in Bor@@ deaux what I am hoping for , and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of European civil security .
If the European citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being , if the mandate that our President , Mrs Fontaine has stak@@ ed on a closer relationship between the Union and Europe &apos; s citizens is to be effective , our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency .
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force , real civil relief blue hel@@ m@@ ets , who would go to areas in difficulty within the Union , as we currently have no emergency procedure , but also outside the Union if needs be , in Venezuela or anywhere else , is something that we should hope to see .
I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit .
Mr President , Commissioner , when we compare the frequency with which stor@@ ms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation , we see that Europe gets off relatively ligh@@ tly .
Nevertheless , the stor@@ ms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us .
Anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that stor@@ ms ra@@ ged in Al@@ s@@ ace as well .
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the stor@@ ms ra@@ ged so fur@@ i@@ ously , and at the same time , from my position here in this Chamber , point to how important it is to support these regions and people .
Each and every one of us knows that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow .
What we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swif@@ tly as possible .
For it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long .
For instance , it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bar@@ k be@@ et@@ le &apos; s lar@@ va@@ e , and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have .
That is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the war@@ mer weather arri@@ ves .
Dec@@ ades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry .
For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow .
The calculations are in decades rather than years .
In addition , I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production , for barrier wood@@ land and wood@@ land that acts as a shi@@ eld against av@@ al@@ an@@ ches also constitute an important factor in certain regions .
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared .....
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I extend our deep@@ est sympathy to all of those who were affected by the stor@@ ms .
Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries .
We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tan@@ ker that s@@ ank .
I was asked to highlight the result of the stor@@ ms in Ireland .
We had high winds and unprecedented , pro@@ long@@ ed ra@@ inf@@ all which , adding to existing difficulties , resulted in thousands of acres being sub@@ mer@@ ged , sometimes , in up to 15 feet of water .
We experienced the human mis@@ ery of floo@@ ded homes and farms , no san@@ itation , no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.@@ co@@ li@@ -@@ infected water .
I talked with farmers whose ew@@ es were abor@@ ting their lam@@ bs due to drinking the infected water .
Natural habit@@ ats were destroyed .
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case .
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force .
Mr President , Commissioner , I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims .
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe .
For the stor@@ ms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of Europe , and I believe we need , in the long-term , to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future .
We certainly do not want market organisation for forests , but maybe we should set up a system , perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector , which will make it possible to mitig@@ ate the implications for the victims in some way .
Unfortunately , we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future .
As has already been mentioned here , there are indications - no proof , but clear indications - that the increase in stor@@ ms world-@@ wide has to do with the climate catastro@@ phe .
Of course , the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet , but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to em@@ it greenhouse gases as we are doing , these stor@@ ms will , of course , hit us much harder still at the da@@ wn of this new century .
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours , Tom Sp@@ enc@@ er . He suggested that rather than giving stor@@ ms the names of men or women , we should name them after the perpet@@ r@@ ators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time .
However , an exception should certainly be made in the case of S@@ hell and B@@ P , for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate , rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future vi@@ ability .
We must be aware of this connection ; I do not support those who make swe@@ eping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm , but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastro@@ ph@@ es if we do not soon alter our course !
I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday .
Food safety
The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission .
Mr President , I am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of out@@ lining to Parliament the main lines of the Commission &apos;s White Paper on food safety , adopted on Wednesday last , 12 January , in association with my colleague , Mr Liikanen .
At my hearing last September , I promised spe@@ edy delivery of this White Paper .
I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly .
The White Paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new Commission was appointed last September .
It takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the Commission &apos;s Green Paper on food law was published .
Equ@@ ally it reflects our experiences of recent food al@@ er@@ ts in such areas as diox@@ in and s@@ lu@@ dge , as well as the BSE crisis .
The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed .
I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe &apos;s food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and al@@ er@@ ts of recent years and months .
The Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world .
When I launched the White Paper last week I said that the shopping trol@@ ley is one of the most pot@@ ent weapons on the face of the earth .
The most disc@@ erning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe .
If their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions .
This in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers , producers and industry generally .
In an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually , even a slight di@@ p in confidence levels can have significant effects .
Between the ag@@ ro-@@ food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees .
High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness .
This crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of ero@@ ding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and European level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety .
In saying all of this , I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the saf@@ est food control systems .
The challenge is to make the system the very best .
The overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food .
We are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change .
The Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule .
We will also need the ful@@ l@@ est support from the Council and other key stakeholders .
The White Paper on food safety out@@ lines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernis@@ e existing EU food legislation . All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent , understandable and flexible .
We want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers .
The detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years .
Over 80 measures are envisaged .
Our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002 .
We are also envis@@ aging the establishment of a European food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime .
This idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate .
It has already attracted much comment , including reactions from Members of Parliament .
The chapter of the White Paper devoted to the establishment of a European food authority is clearly designed to el@@ ic@@ it views and comments . We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envis@@ age .
I will return to this process of consultation in a few moments .
The Commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of ass@@ uring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence .
Why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change ?
The first key concern is independence .
Key stakeholders , including consumers , are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all v@@ ested interests .
We must also ensure excellence and transparency .
We have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the BSE crisis .
However , the Commission believes that we must go further .
We must create a permanent and truly independent , excellent and transparent system of risk assessment .
The key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety .
We envis@@ age that the work of the existing five Scientific Comm@@ itt@@ ees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority .
They may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will el@@ ic@@ it views before making our definitive proposals on the authority &apos;s establishment .
However , if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deck@@ chairs , this would clearly not be enough .
As the White Paper makes clear , the new authority must be a valu@@ e-@@ added structure .
I am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened .
Within the authority I envis@@ age much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists .
I am also envis@@ aging that the authority will be much more pro@@ active than our current regime - anticip@@ ate rather than react , identify issues before they become crises .
This pro@@ active approach should become the hall@@ mark of the authority .
To be pro@@ active the White Paper identi@@ fies a number of new areas that would be embra@@ ced by the authority .
These include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function , the coordination of scientific information in the EU , and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in Member States .
As part of its re@@ mit we also envis@@ age the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns .
The Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to de@@ vol@@ ve risk management power to the authority .
We believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission , Parliament and Council .
I make no ap@@ ology for this approach ; I firmly believe that it is the correct one .
Certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law@@ -@@ making powers to such an authority .
I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion .
It was only last year that the Treaty was amended to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process .
To give such a role to an authority at this stage would be , in my view , a retro@@ grade step and represent a di@@ lu@@ tion of democratic accountability .
I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter .
There are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority .
I also reject this line of argument . How could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-@@ founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety ?
Would this be in the interests of Europe &apos;s citizens ?
In my view , most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were sound@@ ly based , ration@@ ally argued and fully justified .
It seems difficult to envis@@ age such a situation evol@@ ving .
I can assure you here today that the Commission , in exerc@@ ising its risk management functions , will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority .
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States .
This is a major task .
We must develop greater certainty in the science that under@@ p@@ ins food safety in the European Union .
The authority must become the authorit@@ ative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues .
This situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evol@@ ve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself .
I do not believe we can be prescri@@ p@@ tive in the area of science and advice based on science .
However , with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies , the authority will become pre-@@ emin@@ ent on the European stage .
I am also anx@@ ious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard .
As an integral part of a valu@@ e-@@ added structure , the White Paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication : to dis@@ semin@@ ate complex scientific information in a consu@@ mer@@ -@@ friendly way ; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-@@ the-@@ minute data on risk ; to be highly visible ; to tell the good news story about food ; to be pro@@ active .
The White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls .
This is a hu@@ gely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that Member States and operators are compl@@ ying with Community legislation .
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena .
In this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veter@@ inary office located in Dublin .
This revised Community framework would have three core elements : operational criteria set up at Community level , Community control guidelines , and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control .
As part of our proposals in this area - which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year - I will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the Commission . These could include with@@ holding Community financial support or rec@@ ou@@ ping funding already committed to a Member State .
These proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world , boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union .
In addition to the proposals for a new European food authority and an enhanced control system at Commun@@ ity-@@ level , the White Paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the Community &apos;s legislation , covering all aspects of food products from farm to table .
It sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified lo@@ op@@ holes in current legislation .
The new legal framework will cover animal feed , animal health and welfare , hygiene , contam@@ in@@ ants and resi@@ du@@ es , novel food , additives , flav@@ our@@ ings , packaging and ir@@ radiation .
As regards the precautionary principle , I might add that the Commission is currently fin@@ alising a communication which I expect to be adopted very soon .
I look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available .
However , having regard to my contacts with the pres@@ idents of the relevant committees , I recognise that this was not feasible .
But I know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the White Paper &apos;s proposals on the authority .
We now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the Commission &apos;s ideas on the White Paper on the establishment of a European food authority .
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate . Parliament played a crucial role in Europe &apos;s response to the BSE crisis .
It has especially active since then in bringing citizens &apos; concerns about food safety issues to the fore .
I expect that Parliament &apos;s contribution to the debate on the authority can be as inc@@ isi@@ ve and constructive .
While we have a number of months to the end of April to debate the issue and gar@@ ner our views , I recognise fully that this is also a very tight tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame .
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible .
It is essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament &apos;s contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the European Union &apos;s food safety regime .
The European food authority will be a key ing@@ re@@ dient in the EU &apos;s food safety regime in the years ahead .
It is essential that we get the mix right .
Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his statement .
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions , including the Commission and Parliament .
That is very much the right approach .
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight . I hope that we can th@@ ras@@ h this out .
We need a body of food law , as you have said , and we need to agree this together .
It is very important that we include liability in that process .
That is the one word I am talking about .
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong .
That cannot continue .
When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem , those responsible are liable .
Mr President , it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority .
My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed .
You are unclear about this in your White Paper .
What is your schedule , how long will it take you to produce a positive list ?
When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof ?
The final part of my question is as follows : when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States ?
That is another point , i.e. the question of obligation , which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper .
Thank you , Commissioner , for your statement .
I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality .
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency , so there is not very much point in your proposing one .
Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feed@@ ing@@ stuffs .
However , as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years , I have to ask : if Europe has the saf@@ est food control system , as you have said , why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives ?
Secondly , will this not compo@@ und the problem of over-@@ regulation from Brussels and under-@@ implementation in the Member States ? We look forward to a fruit@@ ful dialogue with you on this .
Regarding enlargement : what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws , given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis commun@@ au@@ taire by 2003 ?
President , first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ah@@ ern , Mrs Roth@@ -B@@ ehr@@ endt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper .
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised .
Mrs Ah@@ ern raised the issue of liability .
That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of trac@@ e@@ ability .
Once that is done , issues such as liability can be addressed .
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background , but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved .
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration .
Mrs Roth@@ -B@@ ehr@@ endt asked me about establishing a positive list .
That is one of the issues that we address in the ann@@ ex to the legislation , and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material .
At the moment the list is , as I say , a negative list and it is added to as required .
The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the ann@@ ex with a date attached to it , 2002 in fact .
The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation .
Rap@@ id alert is there for food but not for feed .
This is unfortunate and it is wrong , and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done .
The work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of inf@@ ectiv@@ ity in Member States is ongoing , I know that Mrs Roth@@ -B@@ ehr@@ endt has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming along quickly but I understand it is in inter-@@ service consultation in the Commission and work is currently under way .
I hope that the next time you ask me the question , I will be in a position to give you more detailed information .
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compo@@ unds over-@@ regulation .
I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation .
It is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation , although that is part of it , but of identifying where there are gaps and lo@@ op@@ holes in the chain from farm to table and closing them .
There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind .
Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen .
Commissioner , the ignor@@ ance of certain Member States has land@@ ed us in a major food crisis here in Europe , and I am afraid that once more I have cause to be an@@ gr@@ y at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in attend@@ ance , and that on the day that you present your interesting report .
What I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind , whatever name it goes by , will be given influence over the Council , who in this authority will have the say in matters , and who will issue orders .
Of course , we are not in a position to dict@@ ate anything in terms of content , but I would insist on Parliament re@@ taining the rights accord@@ ed it under Maastricht and Amsterdam , and even extending them .
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that fli@@ es through Europe an@@ onym@@ ously like a satellite ; an authority of this kind would be an@@ ath@@ ema to me and I hope it does not come to that .
I also welcome the White Paper .
But do you envis@@ age that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France &apos;s refusal to lift the ban ?
You mentioned the Commission being able to with@@ hold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting .
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance , similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment ?
Mr President , you said during last week &apos; s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the peripher@@ y , but you did not mention what that peripher@@ y was .
For example , the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters .
It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather , publish and coordinate data , make recommendations for improved food safety , and - as you said - collect scientific data and popul@@ arise that information for consumers .
All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union .
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location ?
In relation to the ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p of the authority : first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will li@@ a@@ ise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time .
In addition to that , the food safety authority will have a board .
You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p of that board .
This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months .
I envis@@ age that the board &apos;s membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders .
Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September .
We have not done that yet but it will be done in September .
I do not expect that the board will have any function in direc@@ ting the scientists how to do their work .
That would er@@ ode the independence of the scientific advice .
But it would have an overall re@@ mit , particularly , for instance , in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research .
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that .
That is an issue for consideration and discussion .
There may be a number of views on that .
Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nom@@ ine@@ es - to be members of the board .
Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament , through nom@@ ine@@ es or even MEPs themselves , were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated .
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out .
Mr Florenz also raised the question of an@@ onym@@ ity .
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile .
It must be visible . It must be known .
Con@@ sum@@ ers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority .
The CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known , who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food , particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition , diet and such issues , so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority .
They will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bed@@ rock of confidence already built up in the pron@@ o@@ unc@@ ements from the authority .
It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous .
It must be visible .
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority .
Mrs Lyn@@ ne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth .
I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end .
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level .
Quite clearly it is undes@@ irable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for , or advis@@ ing , the food safety authority at Community level may be in dis@@ agreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level .
That is an undes@@ irable situation , we do not want that situation in the future .
There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one .
But information which includes a fundamental dis@@ agreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern .
We must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dis@@ sem@@ ination of information between scientists , that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mand@@ ated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond , where experts are to be found elsewhere .
Over time , as I said a moment ago , not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise , its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challeng@@ ed .
This situation can be achieved over a period of time .
You cannot legisl@@ ate for consumer confidence .
It is something that is earned over a period of time .
However , the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission , Parliament and Council .
I realise that this is a somewhat time-@@ consum@@ ing exercise but , nonetheless , the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward .
Any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way .
One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circum@@ stance .
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process .
In relation to grants and subsidies : yes , consideration has been given to that issue .
It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought , particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a spe@@ edy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling .
In relation to Mrs Lyn@@ ne &apos;s question on interim payments : that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues .
Mrs My@@ ller then asked me about the location of the Authority .
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the peripher@@ y .
I recognise that the F@@ E@@ O is located in Dublin and , although I come from that part of the world myself , I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe !
But the F@@ V@@ O is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority .
The F@@ V@@ O is made up of independent scientists and v@@ ets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin .
The Food Safety Authority &apos;s situation is quite different .
It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initi@@ ation of legislation .
An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean , what problems they have identified , what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise .
Equ@@ ally , the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the polic@@ y-@@ making process or the law@@ -@@ drafting process , to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified .
It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located .
Scienti@@ sts will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to li@@ a@@ ise with scientists on a consult@@ ative basis and , in those circumstances , as scientists will have to travel , it is probably better that they move to a central location , once again where the parliamentary structures and the Commission and Council are based .
That is my jud@@ gement at the moment .
It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the peripher@@ y .
Col@@ leag@@ ues , I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda .
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the Conference of Presidents .
If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important , I would suggest that we require more time than the half-@@ hour that is allocated to them .
On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner , and his statement .
As you can see , half-@@ an-@@ hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session .
I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions .
That concludes the debate .
Question Time ( Commission )
The next item is Question Time ( B@@ 5-00@@ 03 / 2000 ) .
We will examine questions to the Commission .
We will dedic@@ ate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time .
We will cut back our time a little because the interpre@@ ters are working today in continuous session .
Mr Pur@@ vis has the floor for a procedural motion .
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time ; it is one of the few occasions when back@@ ben@@ chers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda .
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda .
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.@@ 30 p.m. , and you can see the clock .
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event .
First Part
Question No 28 by ( H-0@@ 7@@ 81 / 99 ) :
Subject : Con@@ struction of nuclear plant in earthqu@@ ak@@ e-@@ pr@@ one Turkey The two recent earthqu@@ akes in Turkey regi@@ stering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey &apos;s persist@@ ence with the construction of costly nuclear re@@ actors at Ak@@ ku@@ y@@ u , while energy reserves produced by the At@@ at@@ ür@@ k dam@@ s are exported to third countries and the EU sp@@ ends a sli@@ ce of its budget on rep@@ air@@ ing the damage w@@ rought by the earthqu@@ akes .
Turkey &apos;s nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and eco@@ systems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the sus@@ pic@@ ion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey &apos;s political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons , as evi@@ den@@ ced by their attempts to buy re@@ actors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan .
What steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but sp@@ ends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget ?
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
The Commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in Ak@@ ku@@ y@@ u , Turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards .
According to our information , the decision on the selection of a bi@@ d@@ der has not been taken yet .
The Commission acknowled@@ ges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the si@@ ting , construction , commission@@ ing , operation and dec@@ ommission@@ ing of nuclear power plants in Turkey res@@ ts entirely with the Turkish Atom@@ ic Energy Authority .
The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production , including the nuclear option .
As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hear@@ ings in the European Parliament in September 1999 , the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue .
In particular , the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded sei@@ sm@@ ic activity in the area of the Ec@@ em@@ is fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site .
According to information received from the International Atom@@ ic Agency , the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthqu@@ akes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in A@@ dan@@ a .
Large design marg@@ ins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site .
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weap@@ on@@ s-@@ grade material .
It acknowled@@ ges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-@@ proliferation of Nuclear We@@ ap@@ ons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atom@@ ic Energy Agency .
Thank you for your reply .
I should like to make the following points : Turkey is now a candidate country .
This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2 % .
At the same time , it also wishes to acquire C@@ ad@@ ou type re@@ actors from Canada , which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India .
In this sense , there is therefore a serious risk that some idi@@ ot will decide that the new geopoli@@ tical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology .
So much for the political aspect .
Now to the technical aspect .
The safety factor in this type of project , and I am speaking as an engineer , has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty .
In cases such as this , where there is uncertainty , simul@@ ators are used .
However , we cannot used simul@@ ators in cases relating to nuclear energy .
In this sense , all high sei@@ sm@@ ic risk areas must be excluded a pri@@ ori for nuclear installations such as this .
Therefore , and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed , it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union .
A couple of weeks ago we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries .
I have explained the position of the Commission .
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis commun@@ au@@ taire on nuclear safety .
So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have dec@@ ommission@@ ing plans for some re@@ actors that are considered not to be upgra@@ dable .
In the case of Turkey it is different .
The plant is not yet there .
I have already said that Turkey is part of the N@@ PT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety .
If we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey .
If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria .
Mr President , the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non-@@ proliferation treaty , it has signed the nuclear safety treaties : why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey &apos;s nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community , and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Sou@@ lad@@ akis on this matter ?
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concerns and fears .
I do not have these concerns .
I believe that Turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-@@ proliferation treaty , but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament .
Question No 29 by ( H-0@@ 7@@ 86 / 99 ) :
Subject : De@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of trans@@ bound@@ ary pollution arising from the use of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium weapons in the Koso@@ van conflict ?
If not , why not ?
Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
Thank you , Mr Bo@@ we , for your question .
The European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action .
As early as last June the Commission financed a first study .
It was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastro@@ phe .
None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has over@@ turned that original assessment .
The Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan T@@ ask Force .
This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it .
The use of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the Net .
The Balkan T@@ ask Force was ham@@ pered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict .
No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the B@@ T@@ F fac@@ t-@@ finding mission .
However , this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contam@@ inated by depl@@ eted ur@@ anium .
From a desk assessment coupled with a fac@@ t-@@ finding mission the report concludes that the risks , if any , are limited to an area around the target .
Future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-@@ eastern Europe .
A special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed . It will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed .
First of all , Mr President , can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response .
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue .
But I would like to point out that the concern with depl@@ eted ur@@ anium weapons is about the way in which they are used .
This ur@@ anium becomes air-@@ borne , is inhal@@ ed and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far .
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium weapons in the Gulf war .
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects , not just of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a loc@@ alised way within Kosovo ?
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons ?
Thank you , Mr Bo@@ we , for that question .
We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depl@@ eted ur@@ anium was used in the conflict and no depl@@ eted ur@@ anium has been detected in the cle@@ an-@@ up of Kosovo .
But those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium .
That is also mentioned in the report .
No trans@@ bound@@ ary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted .
A big responsibility res@@ ts with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report , so they have to take responsibility .
But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is , for the time being , the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union .
It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States , as well as the United Nations and the Commission , something to think about when it is a matter concerning military sec@@ rets and their effects on the environment .
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons .
Mr President , Commissioner , in a few months &apos; time , hundreds of thousands of holi@@ day@@ makers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday .
We know from media reports that bom@@ bs and weapons were dump@@ ed just off the coast .
Are you able to confirm that holi@@ day@@ makers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer , and are there any measures in the pipeline for as@@ certain@@ ing what the dangers might be in this respect ?
I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to .
We make our jud@@ gements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this .
That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do .
What we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous .
In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution .
That also includes bul@@ lets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system .
Unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the cle@@ an-@@ up exercise .
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now station@@ ed in that region under@@ go special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area ?
I cannot answer that question .
When it comes to medical checks and so on , I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer .
What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned , that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan , but when it comes to medical check-@@ ups I do not have the information about that .
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information .
Question No 30 by ( H-0@@ 7@@ 93 / 99 ) :
Subject : Ap@@ point@@ ment of a European Union en@@ vo@@ y for Tibet In 1998 the Tibetan Government in ex@@ ile received over 4000 Tibet@@ ans who escap@@ ed over the Him@@ al@@ ay@@ an mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and lim@@ b .
Many of the refugees had been severely fro@@ st-@@ bitten and many had died along the way .
The Tibet Inter@@ group is very concerned about the wor@@ sen@@ ing situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibet@@ ans daily in Tibet .
The Tibet Inter@@ group , therefore , gra@@ vely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in Tibet and supporting the Dalai Lama ? s proposal for dialogue with the Chinese Government to resolve the situation in Tibet , calls on the Commission to appoint a Special En@@ vo@@ y for Tibet to address the concerns of the European Union and to help bring the Tibetan and Chinese authorities together for dialogue .
When will the Commission appoint a Special En@@ vo@@ y for Tibet ?
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared .
I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues , including Tibet , firmly and candi@@ dly to the Chinese authorities .
The European Union did that at the European Union ­ China Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues , including Tibet .
We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama .
I urge the Chinese again to do so .
We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities .
We are also doing a number of other things : in the European Uni@@ on-@@ China human rights dialogue , we have focused on a number of practical steps , including sending experts on assign@@ ment to Tibet , planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health , education and training for Tibet@@ ans .
The appointment of an EU special en@@ vo@@ y for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them .
But for my part , I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts .
It would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in ex@@ ile .
I am also keen to guard against an exp@@ on@@ ential growth in the number of special en@@ vo@@ ys , however worthy the cause .
Mr President , Mr Patten , of course , you are very well-@@ qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China , and you are well aware of how hard the Tibet@@ ans are trying to initiate a debate , something which has always been blocked hi@@ therto .
However , if your response was to be that we should turn to &quot; Mr CF@@ SP &quot; , that is , to Mr Solana , then I fear that this would constitute a one-@@ si@@ ded approach to an external policy matter .
Your approach , which I am very much in favour of , since it is a coherent one , takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights ; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embra@@ ce the cause of human rights .
Imp@@ ris@@ onment , torture , the mu@@ til@@ ation of young women and so on and so forth , are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infin@@ it@@ um .
If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this , then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve .
The possibility of stres@@ sing the importance of business and trade in the first place , but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equ@@ ation , would be a step we should take in tan@@ dem with the European Commission , rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council .
Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is .
I stated nothing but the truth when I said that the appointment of special en@@ vo@@ ys was a matter for the Council .
As it happens , we deal with the budgetary consequences , the Council makes the appointment .
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course .
P@@ utting that on one side , because that is the situation , it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues .
I am very much hoping in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out , among other things , that there is no dis@@ junction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in China or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the European Union .
I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most dec@@ ently - everywhere in the world .
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet .
During the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice , first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister T@@ ang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern mani@@ fest .
If I can make a literary comm@@ end@@ ation to the honourable Member , who I recognise is interested in these subjects , I recommend to him a book published just before Christmas written by Is@@ abel Hilton , the distinguished journalist , on the problems of Tibet .
Mr President , I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan gre@@ eting , which bet@@ ok@@ ens peace and happiness .
We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned , rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace , ser@@ en@@ ity , comp@@ as@@ sion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans .
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Hol@@ iness , the Dalai Lama &apos; s , proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair ?
I would point out that doing nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people .
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddh@@ ist tradition .
Like the honourable Member I have read the auto@@ bi@@ ography of the Dalai Lama .
It is an extremely moving account , not just of his responsibilities in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual views as well .
The Commission , like others , has urged dialogue .
The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes .
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that over@@ ture from the Dalai Lama .
At or around the time of President Clinton &apos;s visit to China , the President of the People &apos;s Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda .
It would be very beneficial , not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia , but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People &apos;s Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue .
Question No 31 by ( H-0@@ 7@@ 95 / 99 ) :
Subject : Commission &apos;s rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU According to newspaper reports , the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jac@@ ob S@@ öder@@ man for a citizens ? right to proper administration in the EU .
Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration , it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made , but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service .
Are these reports accurate ?
What is the reason for the Commission ? s acting in this way , and how can it explain the resul@@ tant discre@@ pan@@ cy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration ?
Does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-@@ point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September , and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it ?
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and in@@ accurate .
In November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure .
At the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document , a process which will be fin@@ alised in the forthcoming weeks .
The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading .
It should be noted that the new Commission gave an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code .
The Commission would like to stress in particular that , in the drafting of the code , it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman .
The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission &apos;s administration with the public .
It will be adopted through a leg@@ ally-@@ binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities .
The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman &apos;s office .
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislat@@ or for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself .
However , it goes without saying that the Commission adher@@ es to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner .
However , I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force , bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997 .
The newspaper reports were misleading .
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman .
There is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are sound@@ ly placed on that .
I want to repeat that honourable Members , like the honourable Member who asked the question , who take a particular interest in this issue , will want to have a dialogue about it .
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member .
I want to thank the Commission for what I perc@@ eive as a very positive answer .
For safety &apos; s sake , I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that , where the Commission and good administration are concerned , there is no part of Jac@@ ob S@@ öder@@ man &apos; s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable .
Is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved ?
Let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true !
&quot; I would like to stress again that the Commission has accepted all the Ombudsman &apos;s recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999 &quot; .
Both documents , that is the Commission &apos;s document and the Ombudsman &apos;s draft , cover largely the same ground .
The only substantial question that has ar@@ isen is the legislative basis .
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all f@@ ours with the Ombudsman on this important issue .
We will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten &apos; s notes into the bi@@ bli@@ ography , as another bed@@ side book for the Members to bear in mind .
As the author is not present , Question No 32 lap@@ ses .
I ap@@ olog@@ ise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary dis@@ cour@@ tes@@ y . I am sorry .
According to the Rules of Procedure , you are not required to reply .
I wish you a good evening .
Second Part
Questions to Mr Niel@@ son , who is replaced by Mr Patten
Questions 33 and 34 of Questions to the Commission were intended for Mr Niel@@ son .
Mr Niel@@ son cannot be present today since he is in South Africa .
I must tell you that the Vice-President of the Commission , Mrs Loy@@ ola de Palacio , has sent me a kind letter giving me all sorts of explanations and inform@@ ing me that Mr Patten will reply to the questions .
Question No 33 by ( H-0@@ 8@@ 29 / 99 ) :
Subject : &apos; Ma@@ instre@@ aming &apos; in EU aid policy In 1995 the Council drew up guidelines for integrating the equal opportunities dimension ( &apos; mainstre@@ aming &apos; ) into the full range of EU aid policy .
The guidelines call for all staff working in the development sector to receive continuous training in &apos; gender mainstre@@ aming &apos; but in recent years only around 50 people have been trained and there is still no compulsory training in the subject within the Director@@ ate-@@ General for Development .
&apos;@@ Ma@@ instre@@ aming &apos; means taking account of equality between women and men as an integral part of all forms of development policy , strategy and measures .
To achieve that , the Council &apos;s guidelines must be implemented in their enti@@ re@@ ty .
Cur@@ rent staff must receive compulsory training in equal opportunities and 1-@@ 2 days &apos; training in such issues should form an essential part of the Director@@ ate-@@ General for Development &apos;s introduc@@ tory courses for new staff .
Is the Commission prepared to take such measures ?
Can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague , Mr Niel@@ son , was that he could not be here but the honourable Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is , trying to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survi@@ ves .
The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development , part of the so-called in@@ duction courses for new staff , something that has been done already but not , I admit , on a regular basis .
The training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point .
The training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory .
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management .
As far as possible , we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset , instead of having to be tackled separately and later .
My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstre@@ amed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add@@ -@@ on .
The quest for equality should per@@ me@@ ate the work of the Director@@ ate-@@ General for Development at all levels . It is not to be brought in as a &quot; sort of optional add@@ -@@ on &quot; .
This must naturally lead to a reform@@ ulation of development goals and strategies , together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women &apos; s and men &apos; s priorities and needs are better reflected .
In addition , measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender .
E@@ quality must per@@ me@@ ate not only projects and programmes but also all over@@ arch@@ ing goals , action plans and strategies .
It would appear that we are in agreement about this .
However , responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with de@@ part@@ mental and unit managers .
If the latter do not have the required professional competence , then nothing will happen and gender mainstre@@ aming will no longer be a priority .
Extre@@ m@@ ely few members of the Director@@ ate-@@ General for Development , that is to say unit managers and more senior managers , have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised .
Only one manager has participated in gender training , and for half a day .
That is naturally unacceptable .
What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training ?
Gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introduc@@ tory course for new employees , but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course .
This limited training element has , however , been removed from all introduc@@ tory courses which have taken place in recent times .
As I point out in my question , one to two days , and not one to two hours , need to be devoted to the subject .
My question is this : is the Commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstre@@ aming at the Director@@ ate-@@ General for Development ?
Well I certainly take gender mainstre@@ aming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Niel@@ son .
I must not go on about books , but I have just been reading the book by David Lan@@ dis Bar@@ n@@ hill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he att@@ aches to gender issues , in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies , going back mill@@ en@@ nia .
Secondly , in my view , while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential .
And , since it should be essential , I would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training .
That goes for everybody at whatever level of sen@@ i@@ ority .
It is not something which more senior officials can de@@ em appropriate for their j@@ uni@@ ors but think that they are too grow@@ n@@ -up or too senior to receive themselves .
Thirdly , one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-@@ cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground .
So I sympath@@ ise very much with what the honourable Member has said .
I hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practic@@ ality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves .
Since 1991 , the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia .
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TAC@@ IS programme .
In 1998 and 1999 Ky@@ r@@ gy@@ z@@ stan , Kaz@@ ak@@ h@@ stan , U@@ z@@ bekistan and Turk@@ men@@ istan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million .
This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors , in particular agriculture , infrastructure development , the private economy and the strengthening of institutions .
Security considerations have prevented Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan from benef@@ iting fully from TAC@@ IS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.@@ 2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999 .
In addition to national programmes , the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy , transport and environmental sectors .
Food security programmes in central Asia began in 1996 , following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind .
These programmes have benef@@ ited Ky@@ r@@ gy@@ z@@ stan and to a more limited extent , Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan .
Fund@@ ing for NG@@ O programmes in Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan amoun@@ ted to EUR 7.@@ 42 million in 1998 and 1999 .
Over the same period , Ky@@ r@@ gy@@ z@@ stan received EUR 17 million .
Since 1993 the Commission &apos;s European Community Human@@ it@@ arian Office , ECHO , has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan and Ky@@ r@@ gy@@ z@@ stan .
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.@@ 8 million was granted to Ky@@ r@@ gy@@ z@@ stan and Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan received over EUR 35 million , mainly for food , medical supplies , water and san@@ itation .
Frequ@@ ent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process .
Mr President , Commissioner , there is a risk of Central Asia and the Cas@@ pi@@ an Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century .
That is why it is imperative to stabili@@ se the two major states of Turk@@ men@@ istan and U@@ z@@ bekistan in particular .
That is why I would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence , how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going , that is , with regard to political relations that is .
Of course , that falls within your re@@ mit ; my next question falls within Mr Niel@@ son &apos; s re@@ mit in that it concerns environmental cooperation , in particular matters per@@ taining to water and the problems surrounding the cotton mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ es , which are the cause of great ari@@ dity .
We were able , at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago , to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian re@@ public@@ s .
I am very anx@@ ious that we should strengthen our relationship with them .
I can send the honourable Member , if he would like , a detailed break@@ down of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian re@@ public@@ s .
Obviously everyone will hope that his predic@@ tion of what may happen in the future is on the glo@@ om@@ y side .
But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia .
I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well .
He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much dev@@ ast@@ ation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise , had we taken more pre-@@ emp@@ tive measures if those had been possible .
So the honourable Member &apos;s remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made .
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact .
Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty allevi@@ ation .
Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more sound@@ ly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of rap@@ ing the land .
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to .
We also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has appl@@ au@@ ded the Commissioner &apos; s answer .
This is not the usual state of affairs .
And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bi@@ bli@@ ography this time .
Thank you very much , Mr Patten , for your interventions today .
Question No 35 by ( H-0@@ 7@@ 78 / 99 ) :
Subject : Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment , Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies .
The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ? employ@@ ability ? have not yet been reached and it is doub@@ t@@ ful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with .
The report also comments that in Greece there are no plans for medium to long-term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges , or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment policies , and , in addition , that there are no exact employment figures .
Could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long-term unemployment , and what these commitments are ? Has the government legisl@@ ated for and put into place a suitable system for pin@@ pointing , recording and monitoring fluctu@@ ations in unemployment , or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work ?
As far as Mr Pap@@ ay@@ ann@@ akis &apos; question is concerned , in the 1999 Action Plan for Employment , the Commission proposed certain recommendations for Greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment .
The most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services , where problems exist , improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment .
The Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy : &quot; Yes to Work &quot; and &quot; Back to Work &quot; .
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved .
In the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006 , which is being financed from the Social Fund , both the resources and the policies should be used , with the Commission &apos; s support , to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier .
The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it hon@@ ours the commitments which it has made .
Thank you , Commissioner for your reply .
You tell me that you , as the Commission , have made recommendations .
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adher@@ ed to .
However , my question for a very long time has been this : what happened with previous policies ?
Did anyone find work ?
How many people found work ?
If you cannot tell us for this year , then last year and the year before .
What has been done about training ?
Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instruc@@ tors or tra@@ ine@@ es ?
Do we have any figures ?
In other words , do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece ?
Mr Pap@@ ay@@ ann@@ akis , the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computer@@ ised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned , and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for form@@ ulating policies .
Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and , as far as I can see , an increase in productivity .
The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines .
As you know , there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated .
They concern access to training , the ratio of men to women with access to training , and special action for the long-term unemployed .
The Commission will endeavour , for all these specific guidelines , to quanti@@ fy the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006 .
Question No 36 by ( H-0@@ 7@@ 82 / 99 ) :
Subject : Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its enti@@ re@@ ty and whether there are dis@@ agreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy ?
The Danish pension scheme , the E@@ f@@ ter@@ l@@ ø@@ n , only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to reti@@ re .
Some workers have compl@@ ained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to reti@@ re .
The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law .
It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are , however , still pending before the Council .
There is , as yet , no European Court case law on E@@ f@@ ter@@ l@@ ø@@ n , but it could vali@@ dly be argued that the residence requirement is in@@ compatible with general clauses now in force bann@@ ing discrimination on the grounds of nationality .
The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach .
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services &apos; final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be in@@ stituted against Denmark .
I noticed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the Commission , but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been .
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission .
The Commissioner also more than hin@@ ted , of course , that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg , specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discrimin@@ ates against non-@@ Danish wage ear@@ ners who are unable to fulfil the conditions , due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system .
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approxim@@ ate deadlines in connection with this matter , for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio-@@ political debate .
So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could en@@ large upon this question .
Hon@@ ourable Member , I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpre@@ ting the directives and trans@@ posing them into national law .
This is one such case and discussions are under way between the Danish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter , to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who , as things stand , have a right to this pension .
I think that the answer is brief and clear .
Of course it is as you say .
There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark , that is not where the problem lies .
The problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals resi@@ ding outside Denmark .
Question No 37 by ( H-0@@ 7@@ 91 / 99 ) :
Subject : Working time directive Can the Commission say what action it proposes taking to ensure a level of protection , equivalent to that provided by the 1993 working time directive , for non-@@ consult@@ ant hospital doctors , who were excluded from that directive and again from the proposal for a Council amending directive ( COM ( 98 ) 0@@ 6@@ 6@@ 2-@@ C@@ 4-0@@ 7@@ 15 / 98 - 98 / 0@@ 3@@ 18 ( SY@@ N ) ) ?
A proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-@@ consult@@ ant hospital doctors .
The content of the proposal concerns the average 4@@ 8-@@ hour working week of doctors , with the possibility , following negotiation , of increasing it to 54 hours .
The Council , Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is dis@@ agreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive .
Parliament has proposed 4 years , the Commission 7 and the Council 13 .
This proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure .
Although there is this dis@@ agreement , I should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of working doctors throughout Europe .
Question No 38 by ( H-0@@ 8@@ 05 / 99 ) :
Subject : Meas@@ ures to advance gender equality One of the working groups of Commissioners announced by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality ( gender mainstre@@ aming ) .
Which Commissioners are members of this group ?
How many meetings of the group have been held to date ?
What concrete measures have been discussed ?
This question covers several individual matters .
It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality .
The Commissioners taking part are President Prodi , Vice-President Kinnock , Mr Reding and myself .
The meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000 .
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for your reply , although I regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet , since this matter is of the greatest importance . We tru@@ sted this Commission , from the outset , to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women .
I hope that , in the future , things will change and meetings will become frequent , because there are many issues which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude , as quickly as possible , those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women .
Mrs A@@ vil@@ é@@ s-@@ Per@@ ea , that was an ex@@ hor@@ tation rather than a question .
But if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctr@@ ine or good intentions ...
Allow me to say just one word . I agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least , once it did , important decisions were taken straight away .
Question No 39 by ( H-0@@ 8@@ 07 / 99 ) :
Subject : Community E@@ QU@@ AL initiative On 13 October 1999 , the Commission adopted the Community &apos;s E@@ QU@@ AL initiative , the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asyl@@ um-@@ seekers .
Under this umbr@@ ella , each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country .
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States &apos; programmes ?
Which Community body will control the funding of the ste@@ ering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly ?
The European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000-@@ 2006 will total 2 4@@ 87 billion euro . As the E@@ QU@@ AL initiative is a joint funding venture with the Member States , what will Greece &apos;s contribution amount to ?
The E@@ QU@@ AL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people .
Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace .
The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin , where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action .
This is an important aspect of this initiative .
The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation .
This is the same as the Social Fund regulation , i.e. E@@ QU@@ AL comes under the Social Fund regulation .
It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament &apos; s opinion next month .
I should like to stress that the E@@ QU@@ AL initiative satis@@ fies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy .
The Member States , i.e. the national governments , have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies , submitting proposals , selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control .
Within the European Commission , the Director@@ ate-@@ General for Employment is responsible for implementation , while financial control is the responsibility of the Director@@ ate-@@ General for Financial Control , the Anti-@@ Fr@@ aud Office and the European Court of Auditors .
The last question concerns the amount granted .
Greece has been granted ECU 98 million .
The contribution commitment is 80 % , rising to an 85 % contribution from the initiative for the island regions , especially the remote Greek islands , and a contribution by Greece of 15 % .
Mr President , I feel that the guidelines for the Community E@@ QU@@ AL initiative , especially the four actions described in it , will result both in complicated bureaucracy and , paradox@@ ically , a non-@@ transparent structure .
For example , one wonder@@ s how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity , as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines .
At the same time , the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation , the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures , as these are the only structures which can meet such demands .
However , this contradi@@ cts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentr@@ alised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas .
However , at the same time , participation by those actually discrimin@@ ated against , such as asylum seekers , immigrants and so on , is rendered impossible or merely symbolic .
Finally , if you consider the overall amount , which is on the small side , - EUR 2.@@ 8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objectives are , I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing .
First let me say that it would be a great help to us , now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by Parliament , if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account .
Secondly , I have to say that the aim of the E@@ QU@@ AL initiative is not to reduce unemployment , it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment , or to support an increase in employment .
That is the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund , which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal , especially for countries like Greece .
The E@@ QU@@ AL initiative has a specific mission .
To encourage , to assist promotion , to create statistics , to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination .
So what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups , between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences ; that is mainly what we are looking for , and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be em@@ ulated .
This is the philosophy behind the initiative ; the budget is comm@@ ens@@ ur@@ ate with it and our aim is for development agencies , non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible , so that it can get as close to the people as possible .
Question No 40 by ( H-0@@ 8@@ 08 / 99 ) :
Subject : Article 13 T@@ EU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations ( Art. 4.@@ 2 ) .
Could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstances and the groups within Article 13 ( T@@ EU ) likely to be eff@@ ected by such an exemption ?
A month ago , the Commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment , as prescri@@ bed in the Treaty , in order to implement Article 13 .
The ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted .
At the Commission &apos; s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies , Member States and the European Parliament , a number of exceptions have been made .
These exceptions relate to profes@@ sions which must be exerc@@ ised by persons with a genuine professional qualification .
Allow me to give you a specific example to illustr@@ ate this .
In a religious school , it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs .
That is the sort of exemption we are talking about .
Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification .
This is a per@@ verse interpretation of ending discrimination .
For instance , religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example : we do not want to employ you because you are a g@@ ay man or because you are a les@@ bian .
Here we have from the Commission a rein@@ for@@ cement of a hierarch@@ y of op@@ pression .
Sur@@ ely what we should be doing , and I hope you will agree , Commissioner , is eng@@ aging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability , and we should not enshr@@ ine such big@@ ot@@ ry and prejudi@@ ce , no matter how sincerely held .
I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason , be it the reason which you mentioned , sexual orientation , ethnic discrimination or any other reason .
It allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question .
In other words , it is positive discrimination .
In the example which you mentioned , it is only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic .
That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable .
Question No 41 by ( H-0@@ 8@@ 13 / 99 ) :
Does the Commission intend to put forward lowest common den@@ omin@@ ator policies which will properly reflect the ad@@ mitt@@ edly extreme but nonetheless real-@@ life situation of these women , or will their p@@ light once again be over@@ looked by the new employment policies ?
Obviously , the cohesion policy exists for less@@ -@@ favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds , the Social Fund and the Agri@@ cultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy .
I should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget .
The aim of these regional policies , which , of course , are implemented under the jointly agreed European guidelines in each Member State , i.e. each Member State is responsible for implementing this programme , is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women .
I should point out that 70 % of funding for the period 2000-@@ 2006 , i.e. EUR 19@@ 5 billion , will go to the less@@ -@@ favoured regions of Europe .
With particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created , I would like to say , first , that there is , via the Social Fund , an entire equal opportunities pillar which the Member States must implement , i.e. special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources .
Secondly , the LE@@ AD@@ ER initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism , with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions .
Commissioner , thank you for giving me a well-@@ inten@@ tioned answer , which has been rigorous and well-@@ argued .
However , I can assure you that we do not , with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less@@ -@@ favoured regions .
They are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation , where almost none exists .
Therefore , my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on micro@@ credits , which have brought results in cooperation , could be applied to those women in severely less@@ -@@ favoured regions , who have the odds st@@ ack@@ ed against them .
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to .
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need .
With these forecasts of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the forecasts of LE@@ AD@@ ER and rural development , we will not promote , as we should , employment amongst women in the severely less@@ -@@ favoured regions .
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying micro@@ credit policies .
The Commissioner accepts and takes good note of Mrs Iz@@ qu@@ ier@@ do Ro@@ jo &apos; s intervention .
Question No 42 by ( H-0@@ 8@@ 17 / 99 ) :
Subject : Commission &apos;s plans for presentation of a new social action programme It is important that the Commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme , setting out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the &apos; social dialogue &apos; .
Can the Commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme ?
We estimate that the Commission &apos; s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer .
In order to complete the programme and be able to present it , we first need to complete our consultations with Parliament , the social partners and non-governmental organisations .
These discussions have already started , but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon .
The Lisbon European Council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society , economic policy and reforms .
These results will be most important in shaping the Commission &apos; s social programme .
I have already told the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in April between Parliament and the Commission , after the Lisbon conference , so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000-@@ 2006 can finally be drafted .
Clearly , any future social action programme should take account of developments , for example within information technology , and , in time , become a modern social action programme .
But can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter I raise in my question , namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission is planning , as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry ?
We need to see which concrete alternatives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements .
Firstly , I agree with you entirely . Account will be taken of the information society ; that was something which I too mentioned .
Social exclusion , the programme for women , the efforts we are making in the social protection area , everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society .
Secondly , there will obviously be timet@@ ables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented .
Where I cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which , as you know , is not included in the articles of the Treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the Treaty .
Since the author is not present , Question No 43 lap@@ ses .
Question No 44 by ( H-0@@ 8@@ 19 / 99 ) :
Subject : Opport@@ unities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the EU Under Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty , it should be possible for all EU citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Union .
However , for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance , freedom of movement is still highly restricted .
What measures is the Commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area ?
On 26 November 1999 , the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination .
As far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned , there is a directive which concentr@@ ates on combating discrimination , especially in the workplace .
The European Commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and , in the end , to promote the freedom of movement of these persons .
Of course , it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport , services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement .
The European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses , co@@ aches and other vehicles , so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using whe@@ el@@ chairs have access to them .
In addition , you should know that , on 4 June 1998 , the Council approved the recommendation for a pan@@ -European type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs , the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout Europe .
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer .
My question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in Europe .
It is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from Goth@@ enburg to somewhere else in Europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a whe@@ el@@ chair and also need to have a personal assi@@ stant or car@@ er with you in order to manage .
I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan .
It is of course a prerequisite , however , that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physi@@ cally if you have a disability .
It would be interesting to hear whether the Commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have disabilities , so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their whe@@ el@@ chairs take them .
I referred to the directive which the Commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport , so that people with special needs can use them .
It has not yet been passed by the Council ; it is at the consultation stage .
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level .
I think it is exceptionally difficult for us to speci@@ alise in aid programmes for personal transport .
That is dealt with either under special programmes in education , for young people , for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy .
Question No 45 by ( H-@@ 00@@ 06 / 00 ) :
Subject : Comp@@ liance with Directive 96 / 71 / EC concerning the posting of workers The posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in Denmark , even though the deadline has passed .
The draft legislation before the Fol@@ k@@ eting does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements .
Pur@@ su@@ ant to Article 3 ( 8 ) of the Directive , terms and conditions of employment must be in keeping with the &apos; collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers &apos; and labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory &apos; .
However , such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis .
There are therefore two possible solutions : either the Directive is in@@ applicable in Denmark , or Denmark is required by the Directive to introduce univers@@ ally applicable agreements .
Can the Commission confirm that the Directive concerning the posting of workers is in@@ applicable in Denmark as far as &apos; collective agreements ... declared univers@@ ally applicable &apos; ( c@@ f . Article 3 ( 1 ) ) are concerned , given that such univers@@ ally applicable agreements do not exist under Danish law ?
If not , will it explain how the Directive is to be complied with in this area ?
The European Union posting of workers directive stipul@@ ates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country .
What it says it that one of two things may apply , i.e. either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules univers@@ ally applicable to a specific sector .
Because Denmark does not have a system for declar@@ ing collective agreements to be univers@@ ally applicable rules , provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that , apart from current conditions of employment stipul@@ ated in legislation , the hours in univers@@ ally applicable collective agreements , concluded by the most representative organisations , also apply to posted workers .
In other words , to put it simply , Denmark has a choice : it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it .
Dis@@ c@@ ussions are being held between the European Commission and Denmark , and Denmark is expected to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation .
The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission &apos; s questions exp@@ ired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply .
We are waiting to see what the next move will be .
Thank you for a very clear answer , the g@@ ist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of univers@@ ally applicable agreements .
The dis@@ agreement and the correspon@@ dence to which you refer , Commissioner , concern , first and foremost , another directive , namely the working time directive , but now we can fores@@ ee another letter of formal notice and further Treaty infringement proceedings lo@@ oming because the Danish Government does not intend , or has expressly stated that it does not wish , to implement legislation and establish univers@@ ally applicable agreements .
Firstly , no attempt is being made to change the system in Denmark or in any other country .
As I said earlier , there are always problems interpre@@ ting the directives of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another .
As far as your question is concerned , this problem does not only apply to Denmark .
It is not only Denmark which has matters pending .
Five countries have trans@@ posed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage .
What now needs to be done , and this was the reason for the consultations and discussions between the Commission and the Danish Government , and with other governments , is to find the best way forward , so that something which is decided at European level by all the Member States , and which constitutes a general framework , can also include workers posted to Denmark from other countries .
And this is the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine governments to move .
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for your dedic@@ ation .
You have fulfilled your objective for today , which is to answer all the questions .
We congratulate you .
Since the time allocated to Questions to the Commission has el@@ ap@@ sed , Questions 46 to 68 will be rep@@ lied to in writing .
That concludes Question Time .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.@@ 50 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
1997 discharge
The Commissioner , Mrs Schre@@ yer , is not here yet , but I hope , and expect , that she will arrive in the next few minutes .
Nevertheless , I recommend that we start , in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate , and particularly the rapporteur &apos; s speech , from her office , if that is where she still is .
Mr President , I am sure that Mrs Schre@@ yer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be in@@ exc@@ usable otherwise .
I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report , it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation .
Mr President , early last year , the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resign@@ ing Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future .
In its resolution , this Parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious , far-reaching proposals for reform from the new European Commission .
This report , therefore , appears at a crucial time , on the eve of Mr Kinnock &apos; s reforms .
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans .
In the period leading up to this , it already appeared , on the basis of the initial dra@@ fts , that the Commission had made very important ple@@ dges .
We asked for a whi@@ st@@ le-@@ b@@ lower &apos; s regulation , and this is now in place .
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated .
This has now been done .
Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cab@@ in@@ ets .
This is in place too .
Parliament asked the Commission to wai@@ ve its excessive privileges .
It did this as well .
The Commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with Parliament in terms of SE@@ M 2000 .
Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices .
These are sound , first steps which illustr@@ ate that , if this Parliament so wishes , changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly .
We want more than that , however .
The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme .
This is not only necessary for proper public administration , it is a condi@@ tio s@@ ine qu@@ a non of reg@@ aining the trust of the European citizen .
We now demand from the European Commission clear ple@@ dges concerning the following points .
Firstly , Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents .
This , however , pres@@ up@@ poses that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents .
In the context of providing information , I would like to draw the Commission &apos; s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents .
If the current draft is correct , then this is a huge step back@@ wards in comparison to today .
We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not .
Neither can we toler@@ ate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents .
We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with consci@@ enti@@ ous objections can more easily object to tasks which are un@@ ethical or un@@ lawful .
Furthermore , it should be the case that , if the Court of Auditors det@@ ects a mistake not just one year but two years running , the management should be held responsible for it , and this will have an effect on chances of promotion .
Ultim@@ ately , we also need to achieve better cooperation , of course , between the European Court of Auditors and its national counter@@ parts .
This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year .
It should no longer be the case that , although Europe is an economic power , we have no political influence because , when the chips are down , we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desper@@ ately need it . I would quote Gaza as an example .
It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that , as yet , it has been left un@@ used .
Mr President , since 1996 , the discharge has acquired a heavy , political significance .
It is one of the most powerful weapons Parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care .
This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow .
However , we are not sur@@ ren@@ dering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place .
Indeed , the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the Court of Auditors have been clear@@ ed up .
Finally , this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission .
But this does not det@@ ra@@ ct from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order .
As long as we have no status , we are not credible as a force for reform@@ ing the Union .
The reforms of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe &apos; s development process .
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic .
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe .
Mr President , the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so .
We went ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on , that is , by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers &apos; money in Europe .
During the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget .
They were not unique to 1997 and two str@@ ands seem to run through them . The first is a tendency for the Commission to embar@@ k on very ambitious programmes , particularly in third countries , without sufficient assessment of the practic@@ alities of implementation and proper resour@@ cing .
The second involves serious man@@ ag@@ erial shortcomings in the Commission , in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts .
I know that all the Institu@@ tions bear some responsibility for the increasing work@@ load of the Commission and for some of the lack of resources . That cannot excuse everything that we came across .
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so .
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock .
From what I have seen of the reform process , it looks good .
I saw some of Mr Kinnock &apos;s papers today , I heard some of what he had to say .
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need .
But we need that reform process .
Many of the general points raised in our committee &apos;s report have been covered in Mrs van der La@@ an &apos;s report .
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it .
It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports , a series of details .
It groups them together and that is very important .
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to .
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe .
We have to get this right .
The Committee of Independent Exper@@ ts said the Commission was not managing this properly .
We have to remedy that .
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms .
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrut@@ in@@ ise spending .
We need proper information , given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past . It has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible .
I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and , at the same time , that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long over@@ due .
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored .
Mr President , Commissioner , if we are honest , we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation .
We are discussing last year &apos; s discharge , but also the Commission &apos; s responsibility .
I would like to raise the problems which are still pil@@ ed up high on our des@@ ks .
The assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed .
It is about a Commission which is no more .
There is now a new Commission .
Then it is logical to grant discharge , because how can the current Commissioner be bl@@ amed where 1997 is concerned ?
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts .
We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission &apos; s good intentions , but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions .
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month .
We are all very much anticip@@ ating this , but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge .
It is clearly a di@@ lem@@ ma with which the rapporteur has also stru@@ gg@@ led .
This di@@ lem@@ ma stret@@ ches beyond the areas which I have already listed . Take , for example , the ple@@ dges made by the Commission .
They look good in themselves . I have read a few documents written by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them .
But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome : the public nature and confidentiality of documents .
The previous speaker already said something about this .
A document is circul@@ ating at the moment - not at a low level , but at a high level within the Commission - which , instead of enhancing the public nature of documents , is having the opposite effect .
This is an illu@@ stration of empty ple@@ dges not necessarily leading to good results . This also applies to whi@@ st@@ le-@@ blo@@ wers .
Mr Kinnock has also devoted some fin@@ e-@@ sound@@ ing phr@@ ases to this subject but , at the same time , it is entirely unclear , at this moment when we have to make a decision , what , for example , happens with whi@@ st@@ le-@@ blo@@ wers who want to get something off their ch@@ est and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament .
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type .
So there is doubt as to whether these ple@@ dges of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made .
This also applies , for example , to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced .
In my opinion , the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management , but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general , empty proposals .
At the moment , our group still feels sympathy for , and pati@@ ence with , the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past , but this pati@@ ence has a limit .
Cle@@ ar progress must be visible .
At present , we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals , but it is not a for@@ eg@@ one conclusion that it will do so .
Finally , Mr President , the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission .
I express the hope that - in fact , I urge the present Commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission . Otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value .
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge , the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned , in this case in the course of 1997 .
In our Group , we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996 .
In that year , we voted against granting discharge . As a result , we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997 , too .
We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors .
It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised .
So far , the promises which have been made are still , however , to be fulfilled , especially where transparency is concerned .
We are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution , but against the granting of discharge .
Mr President , first of all , I have only positive comments to make on Mrs Van der La@@ an &apos; s very expert work on this report .
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for appro@@ ving the accounts for 1997 .
The report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts .
We support these critical remarks , and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd , against this background , to vote in favour of appro@@ ving the accounts .
It has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an audi@@ tor &apos; s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful , and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we , as Members of this Parliament , were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the leg@@ ality of the arrangements concerned .
The majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new Commission &apos; s implementing a series of reforms , so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous Commission &apos; s period of office is not repeated .
Again , I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission &apos; s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission &apos; s accountability for the future .
We do not think that the new Commission , under any circumstances , could inc@@ ur liability for the past .
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission &apos; s liability as an institution .
The mistakes up until 1999 are attri@@ but@@ able to those who had responsibility at that time , and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better .
By means of this extraordinary procedure , Parliament is st@@ opping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squar@@ ely where it belongs , namely with the previous Commission .
It was the 1996 accounts which led to the down@@ fall of the previous Commission , and the 1997 accounts are just as inc@@ ri@@ min@@ ating .
There is no reason why , against this background , we should agree to grant discharge .
As far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned , we shall ab@@ stain from voting , and where , finally , the motion for a resolution is concerned , we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it .
Mr President , the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erst@@ while Commission , to whom it was to be granted , had step@@ ped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a car@@ et@@ aker capacity .
Mrs van der La@@ an &apos; s report - on which she has la@@ vis@@ hed a great deal of hard work , and for which we are in@@ deb@@ ted to her - proposes that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997 .
One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor &apos; s budgetary management - Mr Cam@@ re just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year , 1996 , was denied .
That is just the way things are , however .
In taking over the mandate , the new Commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made .
Since , on account of the college system , discharge can only be granted to the Commission as a whole or , altern@@ atively , denied or postponed , it is no longer of any consequence that four former Commissioners who belong@@ ed to the previous Commission that has yet to be dischar@@ ged , crop up again as Members of this body .
This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed .
If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control &apos; s proposal this week and grants discharge , then the Commission must not take this to be a blan@@ k che@@ que .
For it is the third section of Mrs van der La@@ an &apos; s report that is the most important , to my mind , namely the motion for a resolution .
The comments contained within , under eight head@@ ings , are an integral part of the discharge , the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision .
In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - Parliament will have to examine , as a matter of urgency , whether or not it was too quick to best@@ ow pre@@ mature praise on the Commission for 1997 .
We will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission presents its reform programme .
We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency , transparency and accountability , and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information , are being displayed vis@@ -@@ à-@@ vis the discharge authority .
Mr President , we all recall that Parliament decided to postp@@ one the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform .
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures .
It is fair to say that the new President , Mr Prodi , and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament .
However , the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run@@ -up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives .
Exist@@ ing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure , for example , that the enlargement process can succeed .
I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analy@@ sed in this debate . But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that , as the European Commission is reformed , it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission .
Mr President , the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997 , but in reality it does not deserve it .
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and , therefore , the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability .
It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission &apos; s re@@ mit .
The new Commission has , on the other hand , undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former sc@@ and@@ als , and I must admit that I am not impressed at all .
The old min@@ d@@ set which involved swe@@ eping things under the car@@ pet and protecting one &apos; s friends unfortunately still exists .
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let by@@ g@@ ones be by@@ g@@ ones and make a fresh start .
I do not , however , think we can make a fresh start if we do not ti@@ dy things up properly .
I am referring here especially to the earlier sc@@ and@@ als involving ECHO .
I am very indi@@ gn@@ ant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter .
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control , and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information .
From the outside , it looks as if the Commission has something to hide .
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case .
The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repe@@ ating ancient practice on the part of the Commission .
It was this practice which led to the Commission &apos; s down@@ fall .
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament un@@ conditional right of access to documents .
Otherwise , we cannot carry out our work .
Thank you , Commissioner Schre@@ yer .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Respon@@ se to Second Report of Committee of Independent Exper@@ ts
The next item is the report ( A5-00@@ 01 / 2000 ) by Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on action to be taken on the second report of the Committee of Independent Exper@@ ts on reform of the Commission .
Mr President , this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts ch@@ ai@@ red by Mr Mid@@ del@@ ho@@ ek to investigate alleg@@ ations of fraud , ne@@ po@@ tism and corruption in the European Commission .
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that : &quot; It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the sligh@@ test sense of responsibility &quot; .
Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resign@@ ation of his entire team .
The resign@@ ation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mi@@ red in alleg@@ ations of scandal .
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition ; a new , rein@@ vigor@@ ated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office .
Spe@@ aking in this House on 21 July President@@ -@@ design@@ ate Prodi under@@ took to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Exper@@ ts on Commission reform , which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today .
The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function .
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted .
In a symbolic but significant gest@@ ure Commissioners have volunt@@ arily ren@@ ounced their enti@@ t@@ lement to the tax@@ -free purchase of alcohol , tobacco , pet@@ rol and consumer goods .
New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials .
The number of departments has been reduced .
The Commission , in my opinion , has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congrat@@ ulated .
The overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong , honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner ; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels ; an administration that recognises and re@@ wards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential .
In order to achieve this , action is required in four areas .
First , financial management and control within the Commission must be improved .
One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control .
The Commission &apos;s D@@ G@@ s must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure , including financial control .
A new independent audit system service must be set up .
D@@ G@@ s must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities .
In return for this greater degree of autonomy , managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions .
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time .
Chan@@ ges to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes .
But while the Commission must ensure that it respects the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase , this must not be an excuse for iner@@ tia .
Ur@@ gent change is required today .
Second , the fight against fraud , mis@@ management and ne@@ po@@ tism must be strengthened , firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thri@@ ve .
This requires a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly , by rein@@ forcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud .
OLAF , the Commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent European public prosec@@ utor whose job will be to prepare for prosec@@ ution by national criminal courts , criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the Union by Members and officials of the European institutions .
A proposal can be made , a proposal should be made , on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty , by the middle of this year .
Third , standards in European public life must be uph@@ eld .
The political crisis which led to the down@@ fall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for un@@ ambiguous and enfor@@ ce@@ able rules of conduct .
A number of codes have since been introduced .
They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding .
The European institutions should follow the example of a number of countries , most notably the United Kingdom , and institute a committee for standards in public life , with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the European institutions .
Whi@@ st@@ le-@@ blo@@ wers who act in good faith must be protected .
At the end of last year Mr Kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whi@@ st@@ le-@@ blo@@ wers . They must be implemented without delay .
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management , they must be an escape val@@ ve when something goes wrong .
Cru@@ cially , reforms must not be limited to the Commission .
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules , administrative procedures and management practices .
Finally , the Commission &apos;s human resource policy must be modernis@@ ed . It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern , multinational organisation .
The social dialogue has often acted as a bra@@ ke on reform and its over@@ hau@@ l is long over@@ due .
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive .
Too many young , new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years .
Mer@@ it must be recognised and rewar@@ ded , specific skills training should be a s@@ ine qu@@ a non for promotion to a higher grade .
The promo@@ tions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent .
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed .
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions .
It must be rid of some of its more out@@ dated elements ; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an exp@@ atri@@ ation allow@@ ance in@@ definitely in a Europe of open borders , or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States .
Commissioner Kinnock will , tomorrow , present his communication on reform .
This communication must contain a clear timetable .
With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be .
En@@ lar@@ gement of the Union is just a few years away .
Now is the time for Europe to put its own house in order ; to in@@ stil in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility .
In June of last year Europe &apos;s voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mis@@ management and ne@@ po@@ tism .
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories . Let us get rid of mis@@ management and ne@@ po@@ tism .
Mr President , I do not want to be mis@@ understood - I sincerely hope this does not happen - and I should therefore like to start by saying that I am , of course , in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate , necessary reforms .
This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis , but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points , in order to make people more aware , if possible , of what we are talking about .
All the experts can provide information and news , form@@ ulate opinions and give advice , but , they have no political or el@@ ective responsibility , and rightly so .
I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be g@@ le@@ an@@ ed from an expert report and what cannot be taken en m@@ asse in a spirit which , on some occasions , I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-@@ destructive .
I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few ideas - that Parliament alone , and no one else , can exert an influence over its Members . If this were not the case , the European Parliament &apos; s authority and represent@@ ati@@ veness would be seriously undermined in the coming years , and this institution would not move forward , as it should .
It is just as important for no-@@ one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation .
Members of Parliament must possess the qualities of mor@@ ality , discipline and discretion over deleg@@ ated issues inn@@ ately , and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else .
I would point out that there is no European legal system , but that a different legal system exists in each Member State .
We run the risk of deleg@@ ating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways .
I agree that an investigation system should be introduced , but I am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and , in any case , the equal need for the right to a defence .
I am opposed to European Community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat : whi@@ st@@ le-@@ b@@ lowing is a method that has no place in the third millenni@@ um .
In conclusion , Mr President , Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy : we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers , not go into reverse .
This debate on the van H@@ ul@@ ten report brings to a close one of the most traum@@ atic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957 .
The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget ; the motion of c@@ ensure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons ; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Exper@@ ts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resign@@ ation of the Commission itself , are now part of European fol@@ kl@@ ore .
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the uph@@ e@@ av@@ al would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated .
Remember that the Council of Ministers , ab@@ sent again this evening from our debate , approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resign@@ ed on 15 March .
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Exper@@ ts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September .
Our greatest concern in the EP@@ P is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored .
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no av@@ ail if the European peoples perc@@ eive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-@@ ze@@ al@@ ous officials .
Under no circumstances will we conc@@ ede ground which we have won over the past few months , which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency .
We are therefore concerned to see the fl@@ ur@@ ry of Commission announc@@ ements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggest@@ ing policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly .
While conve@@ ying a desire to proceed rapidly , it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode .
Our concern is strengthened if the rum@@ our reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information .
This was , after all , one of the causes of the down@@ fall of the last Commission .
Have the lessons not been learnt ?
The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our dis@@ agreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee .
We could , in no way , agree with his view that it would be de@@ meaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package .
The less precise , Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten , we are in our resolutions , the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like .
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the W@@ ise Men &apos; s report should be implemented .
We have , as the EP@@ P-@@ ED group , submitted all the recommendations of the W@@ ise Men &apos; s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report , entirely changing the nature of the van H@@ ul@@ ten report in committee .
We have res@@ ub@@ mitted a few amendments which fell in committee , in particular , our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and man@@ ag@@ erial capacity which you , Commissioner , accepted - when we had our hear@@ ings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct , particularly when considering appoint@@ ments and promotion .
Looking to the future , we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission .
We want in particular to see the hard-@@ working and highly competent nor@@ m for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been dark@@ ened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals .
Commissioner , you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occurred .
In a nut@@ shell : there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available .
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staff@@ ing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible .
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget .
We will be vigil@@ ant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernis@@ e institutions .
But , equally , we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Rom@@ ano Prodi prior to his nom@@ ination .
Let us hope that we can avoid institutional uph@@ e@@ av@@ als by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform .
Mr President , I must start by ap@@ olog@@ ising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Ell@@ es in my presentation .
Can I first thank Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten for this report .
It is an excellent report .
It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in wil@@ ly ni@@ l@@ ly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues .
It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten has produced .
Can I invite Mr Ell@@ es not to put the car@@ t before the horse .
Yes , a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet , and may I war@@ n him that may not be the case tomorrow .
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far .
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change .
Central to this is the attempt to produce and en@@ gender responsibility .
It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission .
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation .
That is important .
We need to stop people passing the bu@@ ck from one to another .
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible .
We need to be assured that consistent under-@@ performance must lead to dis@@ miss@@ al .
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission .
We cannot continue with a situation where in@@ competence , mis@@ management and fraud are co@@ sting the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service .
I will give you one example of this . In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate mis@@ calculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million .
It is clear that is not acceptable .
What happened to the person who was responsible for that mis@@ calculation ?
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit .
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-@@ working .
But we also recognise that some of the practices are out@@ dated .
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because , unlike what Mr Ell@@ es has just said , the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March .
We also need to recognise that people who live in glas@@ sh@@ ouses should not throw stones .
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history .
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves .
Our own staff policy is out@@ dated . Some of our working practices need radical reform .
I hope that the European Parliament will be hang@@ ing onto the co@@ at@@ tails of the Commission in this reform process .
We recognise the proposals on activ@@ ity-@@ based bud@@ get@@ ing . We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities .
Finally , can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public .
European taxpayers need to be re-@@ assured .
The fate of the Commission , of the whole European Union , res@@ ts on delivery of this reform .
That is the key issue , delivery of these proposals .
Mr President , I would like to start by extending my compli@@ ments to the rapporteur , Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten , on his first report .
I very much admire him for keeping his spir@@ its up at a time when he was in@@ und@@ ated with so many amendments .
I think that the report drawn up by the W@@ ise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament - as already stated by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run .
We have submitted an amendment to this effect .
From the many points made by Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten in his report , I would like to highlight a few , not necessarily in order of importance but just rand@@ om@@ ly .
Firstly , I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents .
The Commission &apos; s records leave a great deal to be desired .
We noticed this when we had to investigate the Fle@@ ch@@ ard affair , which , as it happens , has still not been sor@@ ted out .
C@@ uri@@ ously , very important documents had gone missing from the cab@@ in@@ ets , even from those of the President and of various Director@@ at@@ es-@@ General , and this is clearly something which should not happen .
If Parliament want to carry out proper inspections , these documents must be available , and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to improve this situation .
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control .
This has also been partly dealt with in the van H@@ ul@@ ten report .
I think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented .
The general impression at present is that anything bud@@ get@@ -@@ related within Europe is bad .
It is clear that , over the past couple of years , we have noticed an up@@ ward trend in agriculture and a down@@ ward one in structural expenditure .
Is this possible ?
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescri@@ be a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out .
If we admit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten .
It is his first report here in plenary .
This is worth a compli@@ ment although I regret , of course , that he did not ex@@ po@@ und it in his own mother tongue .
It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late .
In my opinion , this is mainly down to the w@@ ran@@ g@@ ling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control .
Let us be honest .
The second report of the W@@ ise Men arrived in September .
We are now four months down the line .
Meanwhile , Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten has been in@@ und@@ ated with amendments , more than 100 amendments in the first round .
He went back to work , re@@ wrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions , but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round .
My fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed , too extensive and too late .
Moreover , I have been informed that the Commission has approved a report - today of all days - on the reform of the Commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our Parliament , I hope .
Mi@@ ght Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening ?
Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten , my Group of the Greens and region@@ alists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon &apos; s plenary meeting to em@@ bel@@ lish this report .
After all , it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of W@@ ise Men word for word in your report .
So tomorrow , if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs , this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more read@@ able .
In any case , it should be clear that my group , of course , fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of W@@ ise Men .
In any event , I look forward to the document which was approved by the Commission today .
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February .
I have to inform you , Commissioner , that both the report of the W@@ ise Men and that of Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten will become gau@@ ges for our group , gau@@ ges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not .
I would like to end on the following point .
Just as the White Paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated , we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission .
I think that there is a need for this , as public opinion is looking for change and , in any event , my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002 .
Mr President , this report is positive but , actually , we need more than this .
Fr@@ aud , mis@@ management and ne@@ po@@ tism do not come from no@@ where . They are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow .
Via the structural funds , a great deal of the European budget is being p@@ ump@@ ed around the system .
This is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States .
But there is also funding which is being p@@ ump@@ ed via Brussels back to the same rich Member States .
Distri@@ cts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and man@@ power in lob@@ b@@ ying and negotiating .
After each incident of impro@@ per use of this money , and certainly after fraud , the call for stricter control is more pron@@ ounced .
Even the stric@@ test control cannot solve this problem . It will , at best , lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects .
It would be prefer@@ able if national governments chann@@ elled this money directly to their local governments without a European det@@ our .
In the next couple of years , we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equ@@ alisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for Member States or their constitu@@ ent regions with a low income per capita of the population .
This is probably the only way to achieve less fraud , less over@@ heads , more transparency and more democracy .
Mr President , a year has not yet passed , but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently .
The first report was widely public@@ ised , formally debated and used - just like the contro@@ vers@@ y and news le@@ aks which preced@@ ed it - to make min@@ c@@ em@@ eat , first of the President of the Commission , and then of the majority of the European Commissioners , even though they had no connection with fraud , mis@@ management or ne@@ po@@ tism .
It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament , nor to the majority of the trade unions , who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration , but , in practice , are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members , putting the wide powers affor@@ ded to them to du@@ bi@@ ous use .
Trade union representatives sit on the Dis@@ cipl@@ inary Board and the Staff Reg@@ ulations Committee , thereby making it impossible to remove dis@@ loy@@ al officials and preserving the Staff Reg@@ ulations in their fossi@@ li@@ sed state .
In@@ comprehen@@ sibly , trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition , and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF , thereby placing this institution which should , at least formally , guarantee its im@@ parti@@ ality , at great risk .
I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time , which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates , discussions and the exchange of information .
Mr President , when it comes to putting its own house in order , the European Commission is in a Cat@@ ch-@@ 22 situation .
There is enormous pressure of exp@@ ec@@ tation following the events that led to the resign@@ ation of the previous Commission .
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound , the more appl@@ ause they receive .
There again , it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few stro@@ kes of the pen , and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to br@@ ass t@@ acks .
This may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue .
Nevertheless , the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see , and I would expressly like to thank Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten for the work he has done on this report .
Provi@@ ded this report is not water@@ ed-@@ down yet again by the adoption of amendments , it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and un@@ ambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points .
Allow me to start with the most important demand .
We do not want financial control to be abolished .
The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made , not in every case , but wherever un@@ certain@@ ties or risks arise .
The Commission is sending out the wrong signals here , by ren@@ aming the Director@@ ate-@@ General for Financial Control as the Director@@ ate-@@ General for Audi@@ ts , for example .
It may well be easy enough to change the Commission &apos; s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts , particularly those relating to budgetary discipline .
I do not have exact figures , but the Community &apos; s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller , to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office .
This cannot be ignored or ev@@ aded , certainly not on account of soft law , as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee .
Ir@@ respective of such legal considerations , it would be an unfor@@ gi@@ vable mistake , under the circumstances , to scra@@ p financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are , at long last , no longer out on a lim@@ b but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investig@@ atory mechanisms .
As we see it , there will be a do@@ v@@ et@@ ailing of three mechanisms in the future : a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller , con@@ comit@@ ant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up , and finally , there will be the targeted tra@@ ck@@ ing-@@ down of irregularities by OLAF , the new anti-@@ fraud office .
It is to be welcomed that Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten &apos; s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie , which must be tackled .
A few s@@ ali@@ ent points : the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect , especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their mis@@ de@@ mean@@ ours , including those of a financial nature .
There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned , and it is precisely in this area that the announc@@ ements made by the Commission are rather vague .
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nu@@ ts that finally need to be cra@@ cked .
Mr President , firstly I would like to extend my hear@@ t@@ felt congratulations to my colleague , Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten .
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am , I think , entitled to feel a little proud of him .
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report .
Mr President , the Commission &apos; s resign@@ ation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarch@@ y and large bureaucracy .
The call to make a cultural U-@@ turn and embra@@ ce a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one .
I have witnessed from close up within the Development Committee how thousands of projects stag@@ n@@ ate and how sometimes up to 80 % of the money is not spent . Sometimes , an enormous reser@@ voir of money is created , not because it is not desper@@ ately needed , not because there are no sound proposals , but because the whole system has collap@@ sed .
A lack of responsibility , too much ex ante , not enough ex post and , as a result , far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending .
It would be marvell@@ ous if this report were to give the green light to resul@@ t-@@ oriented spending of this kind , with all the work organised on that basis .
When the Commission &apos; s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March , I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change .
Without any doubt , this will then be a service , Mr President , to the European public and , by means of the results we produce , we will also reg@@ ain and re-@@ acquire something which we have o@@ sten@@ sibly lost over the past couple of years .
This is the best support we can give to European democracy .
If , in this way , we can move away from the culture of the fif@@ ties and cross over into the next century , we are witn@@ essing a very special moment indeed .
Mr President , first of all , congratulations to Mich@@ iel van H@@ ul@@ ten for his first report .
It was a b@@ ap@@ tism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion : in at the deep end and you will swim in no time .
Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten , I think you deserve a med@@ al for your efforts .
There are two points which , in my opinion , deserve special attention on the part of the EL@@ DR .
Firstly , there is the Commissioners &apos; individual responsibility .
This must be regulated during the IGC .
However , we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have , therefore , submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall@@ -@@ back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council .
Secondly , as already mentioned by my colleague , Mr Mul@@ der , the EL@@ DR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts .
This will contribute hu@@ gely towards re-@@ establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution .
We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counter@@ part to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well .
Only when all European institutions are reformed will we have the open , democratic and decisive Europe which our citizens now finally deserve .
Mr President , I also wish to congratulate Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the House .
I am sure that it will serve , amongst other things , to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups .
At this stage , there can be no delay in the process of reform@@ ing the Commission , demanded by our citizens .
This Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed , even by its Presidents .
It now appears that this desire is more serious .
After the resign@@ ation of a Commission and after a Committee of Exper@@ ts has listed an almost endless number of defic@@ ien@@ cies , it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised , on 14 September , to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February .
This Parliament anx@@ i@@ ously awaits this complete reform programme .
The report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the Committee of Exper@@ ts commissioned by this Parliament .
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway , that he preferred to get things right , but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting .
We therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and , if it is , I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process .
We want a strong Commission , which can act in an independent and neutral manner , but with political sense .
Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office .
Therefore , the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affili@@ ated to their parties .
Perhaps the reference to the posts is imp@@ rec@@ ise .
I do not know your exact view in this respect , Mr Kinnock , but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed .
We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively , and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present .
Therefore , Commissioner , we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme , and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat , but not with this Parliament , which expects profound and dar@@ ing changes .
Mr President , the Santer Commission came to gri@@ ef because financial control failed all down the line .
Therefore , the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swif@@ tly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order .
As far as this is concerned , a number of people have already referred to the fact that the Commission intends to dras@@ tically improve and consolidate its follow-up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis , with no swe@@ eping of matters under the car@@ pet in future .
Naturally , this is only to be welcomed .
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price , as it were , that is , of having to disp@@ ense with independent - and I stress , independent - prior approval .
Up until now , the Commission &apos; s payments could only be made when the author@@ ising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa .
And so it is the &quot; two key &quot; principle that applies here .
A single key is to suff@@ ice in future .
The financial controller is no longer to make advance checks , if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the Commission .
If you will par@@ don me for saying so , Mr Kinnock , what you are proposing is a little like abo@@ lish@@ ing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes .
What we really need to focus on , however , is making the checks more effective .
This could be achieved by no longer insi@@ sting , in future , that the financial controll@@ ers furnis@@ h every single payment transaction with their approval st@@ amp .
It is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all .
Therefore , in future , prior approval should take place in a targeted manner , that is , only in cases of uncertainty or risk .
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentr@@ alised basis , that is , in the operational Director@@ at@@ es-@@ General , amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money , so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less p@@ onder@@ ous and time-@@ consum@@ ing .
However , the financial controll@@ ers must work independently .
That is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the Commission , when it talks in terms of decentr@@ alisation .
It is obviously the Commission &apos; s intention to make the financial control officials sub@@ ordin@@ ate to the individual Director@@ at@@ es-@@ General , but this is precisely what we do not want .
Sur@@ ely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the Leonardo affair , when the internal exam@@ in@@ ers in the relevant Director@@ ate-@@ General issued war@@ nings , but these were neither he@@ eded nor passed on .
Therefore , independence is prerequisite for effective checks .
That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscri@@ bes to .
Indeed , the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence , and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well ?
I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow &apos; s vote .
Mrs The@@ ato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard .
Mr President , a couple of years ago , the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsol@@ es@@ cent structures .
This led to strikes and sme@@ ar campaigns by in@@ transi@@ gent trade unions , wher@@ eu@@ p@@ on the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wis@@ h@@ y-@@ wash@@ y compromise .
This was stup@@ id of the old Commission , and Parliament was of no help on that occasion .
When I read Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten &apos; s passage about personnel policy , I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just sp@@ ou@@ ting a lot of hot air .
There are too many rights , too many regulations and too little room for leadership .
There is no back@@ bone , and no teeth .
Where is the beef ?
And I would also say this to you , Commissioner : please , deliver the beef even if it is British .
Rom@@ ano Prodi promised a revolution .
You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself , but take care now that you do not do@@ dge the crucial issues , the ones where it hur@@ ts !
S@@ ort out the t@@ angle of staff allow@@ ances .
Stand firm on the demand for mobility , not as a right , as it says here in the report , but as a management tool .
En@@ sure too , that training becomes a management tool .
Do not listen to the report &apos; s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed .
It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis .
Finally , Mr President , as a member of the Bureau until six months ago , I would urge you to address this issue in the Bureau so that we here in Parliament at least comply , in our own administration , with the demands we are making on others .
We have not done this so far , and this is something you ought to be instru@@ mental in changing .
Mr President , I want to thank Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten for his report and to say that I voted for it .
So I refer to the things I do not agree with .
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament .
This report is about the Commission .
Parliament is a separate subject .
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission .
In addition to that , there is the question of dut@@ y-@@ free .
That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the dut@@ y-@@ free lob@@ bi@@ es who res@@ ented the fact that the Commission abolished dut@@ y-@@ free in airports .
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either .
Most of the report is about financial control . That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee .
But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by car@@ eless@@ ness in the European Commission .
After all , it is only 1 % of GDP , by comparison with national spending .
We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80 % of these resources are spent by the Member States .
So car@@ eless@@ ness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money .
We should get it into perspective . It is important to remember that .
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money . They have very little of it .
They have a much wider responsibility . That wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment , food safety , foreign trade , the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them .
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust .
If there is , we have generated it in this House in the past year .
I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council , the Commission and Parliament .
We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mist@@ ru@@ sted , doub@@ ted and fear@@ ed by the citizens of the European Union because they were mis@@ managing our affairs .
That is a gross exagger@@ ation of what the difficulties were .
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resign@@ ation of the Commission that went before it .
While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement , for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far .
Mr President , I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report .
I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work .
The process of reform has been going on for some time , and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the Commission .
The Commission &apos; s administration simply does not function particularly well .
Naturally , there are good , capable employees in the Commission , and they are in the majority .
But we need radical reform .
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy .
People should have clear@@ ly-@@ defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable .
The Financial Regulation should be amended .
We agree that we should have better control of the finances .
It is just a question of how .
The Commission and the Committee of Independent Exper@@ ts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control .
We should be careful about this . We should retain some form of ex ante financial control .
It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent .
This would allow too many an@@ om@@ al@@ ous projects to sli@@ p through .
Instead , we should be reform@@ ing and decentr@@ alising control .
The Commission does not have enough staff .
As Members of the European Parliament , we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the Commission &apos; s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it .
And the Commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs .
The staff@@ ing system is too rigid .
There should be a more frequent ro@@ tation of employees , especially at the top of the hierarch@@ y .
It should also be much easier to s@@ ack in@@ efficient and in@@ competent employees .
I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed .
After all , the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms .
Mr President , Commissioners , first of all , I cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is , on the whole , a Dut@@ ch-@@ Bri@@ ti@@ sh@@ -S@@ c@@ andinavi@@ an debate where the speakers are concerned . Perhaps this is a little worrying .
I hope , like so many others , that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved .
We must get away from the idea that we are rus@@ hing to put out a fire in one corner , only then to have to r@@ ush again to put out the next one .
As Mr Bla@@ k said , we must instead establish a system with clear roles .
First of all , we need tough regulations , which can be implemented .
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough . There need to be tough rules stating , among other things , what may be decentr@@ alised , what may be out@@ sour@@ ced and what is independent .
I find it a little worrying that people are cl@@ am@@ our@@ ing for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exerc@@ ised .
What we need , then , are basic administrative regulations for the EU , for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States .
These are what are missing .
We have asked for a Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos; s Office and criminal law , but we also need administrative law for the EU .
We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt , as binding regulations , the om@@ budsman &apos; s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice .
The van H@@ ul@@ ten report is a step in the right direction , but it is not enough .
Secondly , we must also clarify our own audi@@ ting roles .
The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are in@@ compatible with the regulations , but it should not examine the ex@@ pedi@@ ency of a particular action .
It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation .
We do not h@@ unt down criminals . That is OLAF &apos; s job .
T@@ ell me what national parliament , for example , is handed all preliminary investigation documents .
Obst@@ in@@ ate as I am , I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circul@@ ating on the Internet . Otherwise , we shall not get anywhere in this fight .
Mr President , I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report .
I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch , now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so .
Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this .
I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement , also with its amendments .
I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic .
I think that this is also the case here , but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments .
I would also point out that our coordin@@ ator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pom@@ és Ru@@ iz , who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective .
Mr President , one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is , to my mind , the rapporteur &apos; s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration .
A very important proposal indeed .
I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to sub@@ ordin@@ ate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan , because she wants to scra@@ p it altogether .
I cannot fully gr@@ asp the underlying r@@ ationale .
On the one hand , we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but , at the same time , Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of sc@@ or@@ ched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well , as a result of which , in fact , the entire content of this report van@@ ishes .
I do not know whether this is to appe@@ ase Mr Kinnock , but I happen to know Mr Kinnock .
He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary .
In my opinion , such a far-reaching sc@@ or@@ ched earth policy is really unnecessary .
Finally , the issue of officials .
Ac@@ tually , I do not entirely share Mr Haar@@ der &apos; s view .
I do agree that the section on officials has , in fact , been completed totally in@@ adequately .
First of all , the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised .
Secondly , all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mo@@ oted , and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terri@@ bly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement .
For example , we are currently looking into TA@@ Os . This is a key point but , at the same time , we want to abo@@ lish temporary staff at the Commission .
These two considerations are diam@@ etri@@ cally opposed to each other , and I really fail to gr@@ asp how such a proposal can end up on the table .
Mr President , ever since Plat@@ o &apos; s &apos; Republic &apos; , the Western world has regularly been temp@@ ted to replace government by the people with government by experts .
Our Parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the European Commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine , themselves , what its future should be .
In this second report , the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in Parliament , which may have hes@@ it@@ ated to remove the European Commission from office , since they shared the political affili@@ ations of some of its members . The experts think that this problem will be resolved by bann@@ ing the Commissioners from belonging to political groups .
According to the experts , Parliament should no longer have the power to super@@ vise the European Commission . This task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life , and this should be a standing committee , not elected , presum@@ ably made up of another group of experts .
This lesson in wisdom is 100 % ideology and 0 % knowledge .
This will not help us to reform the European institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions .
The van H@@ ul@@ ten report started out as a brilliant one and I would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten achieved .
Unfortunately , it was then changed , and changed for the worse , which turned it into a document which in fact , proposes something that we cannot accept .
Mr President , Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten , your work is worthy of being qualified as enter@@ pris@@ ing , ar@@ du@@ ous and complex , and I believe this is important in a first report .
Please therefore accept what I am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate , and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be ri@@ cher .
This report seems to me to be redundant , long-@@ win@@ ded , confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used .
Perhaps &apos; redundant &apos; is the most serious epi@@ th@@ et , and you are not responsible for this . It is the responsibility of this Parliament .
That is to say , if this Parliament commission@@ s a Committee of Exper@@ ts - and I am not going to repeat what Mr Cas@@ aca has said , but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem , where is the sense in indul@@ ging in the medieval tradition of critic@@ ising the critics and so on , ad infin@@ it@@ um .
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission , we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them .
Meanwhile , we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence .
&apos;@@ Long@@ -@@ win@@ ded &apos; .
I am not going to mention the length of this report .
I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here , but , for this type of resolution it certainly does .
I do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop .
It is also &apos; conf@@ using &apos; .
I am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning Parliament .
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue , but not in this report .
And finally , Mr President , frank@@ ly , I am not going to give examples , but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy .
Therefore - in summary - I await , and many of us await , your report , Commissioner Kinnock , so that we can really express our opinion on it , which is the duty of this Parliament .
Mr President , the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are .
When one considers the events that have set these endeav@@ ours in motion though , it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them .
H@@ opes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control .
The concept of transparency stands out in the report .
Sec@@ uring this is a major priority .
The importance of smooth@@ -@@ running , comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough .
This is not just about bureaucratic reform , however ; rather , it is about showing good will towards the citizens .
We must win back their faith in EU politics .
The citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for EU provisions to be comprehensible to them .
This is what enables them to understand what is going on . They want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served
Whether or not the reforms succeed depends , to a very large extent , on the Commission &apos; s own initiative .
However , it anno@@ yed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis .
I believe , Mr Kinnock , that not@@ with@@ standing all the success achieved on a personal level , the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justi@@ fi@@ ably high expectations .
Can I begin by stating for the record and for the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of Mrs Lan@@ gen@@ ha@@ gen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission &apos;s - it was the decision of this Parliament !
So if she has any lec@@ tures to offer they are best contained within this House .
She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House , there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full , formally and in detail for everything I have done .
Mr President , may I begin by paying tribute to the pain@@ st@@ aking and , from what I hear , the pain@@ s-@@ accepting work of Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten in preparing his report .
Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects , certainly in his famili@@ arity with the Institu@@ tions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance , as several Members have said , to all of our Institu@@ tions .
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative .
Mr President , as you will know , Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten &apos;s report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Exper@@ ts is necessarily long and , since I want to make a comprehensive reply , particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control , I seek your indul@@ gence .
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary .
When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Exper@@ ts last September , I ple@@ dged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ing@@ re@@ dient in the Commission &apos;s reform proposals .
Our efforts to completely honour that ple@@ dge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today , well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago .
I am sure that Mr Pom@@ es Ru@@ iz is encouraged by that .
The great majority of the paper &apos;s proposals are closely ak@@ in to those put by Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Sta@@ es - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform .
There is nothing therefore that is open-@@ ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to comp@@ ile .
The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance .
I would say to Mr Ell@@ es that we are most definitely in listening mode .
But he will appreciate - with his custom@@ ary gener@@ o@@ sity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing , it is first necessary to trans@@ mit what we are proposing .
Hence the transmission .
Though time forbi@@ ds me , Mr President , from comm@@ enting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House , I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas .
Tur@@ ning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations .
The need for transparency is rightly stressed , not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also dem@@ y@@ sti@@ fy what the Commission does .
This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable , not just to this House , but more generally to the European public .
Naturally , sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information , but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible .
I have repeatedly emphasised that , indeed not just as a Commissioner , but in 25 or 30 years of campaign@@ ing .
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission .
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform .
As the House knows and has repeatedly said , the scale and scope of the Union &apos;s financial interventions have grown immen@@ sely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staff@@ ing or an adjustment in procedures .
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today &apos;s debate .
We share the view , for@@ c@@ efully expressed by the Committee of Independent Exper@@ ts , and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough over@@ hau@@ l of our rules and procedures .
The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical rec@@ asting of the Financial Regulation in April .
Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital .
I share the view expressed by Mrs The@@ ato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law .
Change in the law is fundamental .
There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full re@@ ass@@ ur@@ ances in the reform strategy , but en@@ act@@ ment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system .
Es@@ senti@@ ally - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centr@@ alised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that Director@@ s-@@ General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the European Union budget .
In addition , and to achieve better ass@@ ur@@ ances than those provided under the present system , the new system of decentr@@ alised controls must be compl@@ emented by setting up an internal audit service - &quot; the second key &quot; as Herr Bös@@ ch said , established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Exper@@ ts .
That service will open on 1 May this year .
It will be headed by a profession@@ ally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation .
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audi@@ t Pro@@ gress Board ch@@ ai@@ red by my colleague , Mrs Schre@@ yer , who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening .
As Budgets Commissioner , here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors .
This Audi@@ t Pro@@ gress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audi@@ ts .
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them .
The proposed change will make the systems more effective , both in terms of in@@ puts and in terms of measured and accountable out@@ comes .
I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called &quot; a big b@@ ang approach &quot; .
Financial control &apos; s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be rel@@ inqu@@ ished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate .
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centr@@ alised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Exper@@ ts .
That committee was very clear about the need to abo@@ lish the centr@@ alised ex ante visa .
It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control .
In addition , I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997 .
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Kar@@ l@@ sson &apos; s comments to this House last month .
&quot; The Commission &apos;s internal control &quot; he said &quot; is not for@@ ceful enough in preventing incorrect operation .
For instance , the Financial Controller granted a positive a pri@@ ori visa in most of the cases of mis@@ management or irregularities recently un@@ covered .
At the same time , the internal audit function is carried out in an un@@ coordinated way by several bodies , notably the same Financial Controller , the In@@ spec@@ torate General and by some units operating Director@@ at@@ es-@@ General . &quot;
The centr@@ alised ex ante approval system was doub@@ t@@ lessly originally designed to ensure car@@ eful@@ ness but , over the years , it has had the per@@ verse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions .
I do not believe that there is any real dis@@ agreement between us on this .
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying pre@@ occupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition .
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document .
Our objective , the committee &apos; s objective , the Court of Auditors &apos; objective is not to abo@@ lish financial control , it is to get rid of and improve upon centr@@ alised financial control .
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months .
Tur@@ ning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud , corruption , mis@@ management and ne@@ po@@ tism : the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wron@@ g-@@ doing .
As I made clear in the hear@@ ings last September and on other occasions , we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed .
Since June of last year , the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities .
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report susp@@ ected wron@@ g-@@ doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarch@@ ical line .
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed .
We are seeking to implement best practice .
Seri@@ ous response to reports , confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wron@@ g-@@ doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by un@@ timely disclos@@ ure .
As a cor@@ oll@@ ary , there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false alleg@@ ations .
A communication later this year will give full details .
I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose . I am persu@@ aded , however , by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability .
We already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thorou@@ gh@@ ness , fair@@ ness , consistency and professionalism .
And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Dis@@ cipl@@ inary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament .
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change .
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House .
With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework .
This will be taken a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life .
That is in line with the draft resolution .
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to super@@ vise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions .
I welcome Parliament &apos;s support for that .
We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents , made in paragraph 50 of Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten &apos;s report .
The draft resolution rightly rec@@ alls the Commission &apos;s accountability to this Parliament .
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission &apos;s practical commitment to that .
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents .
The point was very properly raised by Mr Ell@@ es and referred to by Mrs Th@@ ors .
I am sure they are aware that in mid-@@ December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament .
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text .
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible .
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform .
I am glad to say to Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten and Mr Haar@@ der that the detailed recommendations on recruitment , training , app@@ ra@@ is@@ al and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals .
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions .
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities .
Members , who , in the course of this debate , have properly pra@@ ised Commission officials , who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity , hard-@@ working and of great capability , are absolutely right in the comments that they have made .
While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points , detail and precision are obviously essential .
A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months . Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House .
It is , mean@@ while , very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament , as an institution , on central matters of common interest , notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations .
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay , conditions , staff representation rights and so on , but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters .
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consult@@ ative idea would be especially welcome .
I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change .
That is most certainly relevant .
We are sure that there will be an important &quot; reform divi@@ dend &quot; as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources .
It is very clear , however , that parts of the Commission services are already very stret@@ ched .
Parliament has frequently made that point .
Secondly , it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology .
Thirdly , it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken .
They are already having implications for resource availability .
It is also clear that if we take on new tasks - which we will surely be asked to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called &quot; negative priorities &quot; and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity .
A central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for t@@ ying the process of prior@@ ity-@@ setting into resource allocation under a system of activ@@ ity-@@ based management .
I want to emphasise , however , that whilst internal discipline on prior@@ ity-@@ setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission , it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission .
The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten &apos;s report .
I conclude , Mr President , by thanking the House for its attention during an un@@ avo@@ id@@ ably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur , to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committees which gave their opinions .
We look forward to working closely with this House on the fin@@ alisation of the reform strategy package and then , most important of all , working together with this House on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such comp@@ lexi@@ ties .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
( The sitting was closed at 11.@@ 15 p.m. )
Middle East peace process ( continuation )
The next item is the continuation of the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East peace process .
I am very grateful to the President of the Council for the statement this morning on the Middle East at the beginning of this debate and for hearing some of Minister G@@ ama &apos; s insi@@ ghts , as he arrived hot@@ -@@ foot from the region .
My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Rec@@ on@@ struction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East , even though , as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events con@@ spired to mar@@ oon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki .
Such is life .
I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would , in all normal circumstances , wish to do .
The debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis I had arranged to see visitors from the Balkans this evening .
So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion .
It is not something , I assure you , which I would wish to make a practice of .
Like honourable Members , I welcome the United States &apos; efforts that have rel@@ a@@ un@@ ched the Syri@@ an / Israeli negotiations , despite the Syri@@ an decision that they needed more time before resum@@ ing the talks that were scheduled to start again today .
There is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future .
I also hope that progress in the Syri@@ an track will pa@@ ve the way for an early resum@@ ption of Leb@@ anese / Israeli talks which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on Israel &apos;s relations with its northern neighbours .
At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track .
The situation of the Palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict .
A fair and , indeed , generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the Middle East .
Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Shar@@ m el@@ -S@@ heik@@ h Mem@@ or@@ an@@ dum .
Although there has been some sli@@ pp@@ age , I trust that the remaining Israeli tro@@ op re@@ dep@@ loy@@ ments will materi@@ alise soon .
Similarly , despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the Framework Agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid-@@ February deadline , I very much hope that the much more important September deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached .
I was re@@ assured that this was also the view of Prime Minister Bar@@ ak and President Arafat , when they met on Monday .
Hon@@ ourable Members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resum@@ ption of progress on the multilateral track .
This is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible , in close li@@ aison with the US and Russian co-@@ spons@@ ors as well as the regional parties .
We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development .
The beginning of the talks with Syria p@@ aved the way for a conven@@ ing of the multilateral ste@@ ering group in Moscow at the end of the month .
I look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again .
The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process , as all sides - Palestinians , Israelis , their Arab neighbours and the United States - have acknowledged .
Nor is our role confined to that of ban@@ ker .
We must be prepared to act swif@@ tly to support the consolidation of peace in the region .
But we should not k@@ id ourselves : a comprehensive Middle East peace deal comes with a hef@@ ty price tag .
The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments .
We intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with Parliament and Council soon .
But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no sl@@ ou@@ ch when it comes to financial support for the peace process .
We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians .
We have also offered very substantial support to Jordan , Lebanon , Syria and Egypt .
With the Israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them .
The Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed the Palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deterior@@ ated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza .
European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 8@@ 60 million during that crucial period .
In this context , let me appl@@ aud the important steps that the Palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency .
President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week .
This will be a good opportunity to address the need to take simil@@ arly courage@@ ous steps to improve the Palestinian administration and to bol@@ ster the rule of law .
The Commission is actively involved in those efforts .
The Commission has also step@@ ped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arab@@ s .
We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year .
This package included renewed assistance for peop@@ le-@@ to-@@ people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arab@@ s meet on non-governmental and expert levels .
Members will recall that the European Union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East .
A number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of Community support in the coming phase of the peace process - among them , helping to consolidate a Gol@@ an settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting de@@ mining and the re@@ building of communities in the Gol@@ an Hei@@ ghts .
Syri@@ an economic development will need assistance for the transition from a war@@ time to a peace economy .
Rec@@ on@@ struction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon , the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict , will also demand considerable efforts .
We also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole .
A solution is needed to the Palestinian refugee problem - these are the largest group of refugees in the world , num@@ ber@@ ing nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenges ahead .
We must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region &apos;s very scar@@ ce water resources .
Lastly , but maybe most importantly , we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas , bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems .
It is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magn@@ it@@ ude of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace .
I want to underline that point .
I wish insi@@ st@@ ently to remind the Council and , should it be necessary , Parliament , that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing .
I repeat that a change in the politics of the Middle East will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide .
I hope I can add that we will want to provide that .
We have made progress in recent months and weeks , as Mr G@@ ama mentioned earlier .
But it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and dis@@ appoint@@ ments on the way .
We will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome .
Lastly , I will repeat for some who have entered the Chamber in the last few minutes , what I said at the outset of my remarks : that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate , largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the Balkans for this evening .
I hope the House will understand that .
Mr President , Commissioner Patten has our understanding .
I would like to tell him that communications with Madrid are usually more flu@@ id and , therefore , I hope to see him there soon .
The statements we have heard today on the Middle East peace process are very opport@@ une at the moment because of the hur@@ ried tour which Minister G@@ ama - whose absence from this debate I also regret - has made of the region , accompanied by other Council representatives .
The tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a p@@ essimis@@ tic view of the situation .
I hon@@ est@@ ly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation .
In this sense , I share Commissioner Patten &apos; s positive attitude .
Let me explain : it is true that the Israeli Government has delayed the third hand-@@ over of West Bank territory to the Palestinian authorities .
This is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks , as Prime Minister Bar@@ ak has promised .
On the other hand , the decision to delay the second round of talks , initiated in Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ st@@ own by the Syri@@ an Arab Republic , is undoubtedly significant , but I am convinced that the hopes which were raised on 3 January in that town will not be d@@ ashed .
Mr President , the fact that the different groups in this Parliament are tab@@ ling a motion for a resolution , in this ever controversial debate , which is the result of a broad consensus , seems to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisi@@ vely support open peace processes .
I would therefore like , equally firmly , to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences , which are still no doubt profound , between the parties .
In my jud@@ gement , this constitutes a guarantee to both sides , both from a political and a financial point of view , of the commitment they can expect from the European Union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for .
It is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to co@@ operating in the development which is needed to he@@ al the serious social differences which exist .
But this also serves to make a claim , on the part of the European Union , for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution - we do not have aspirations to be ban@@ kers - and which will be su@@ itably visible to the public .
There is absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the President of the European Parliament to the region will contribute to this .
Mr President , I want to thank Commissioner Patten for his detailed account .
I should like to say that I agree with the tone which Gal@@ e@@ ote Qu@@ ec@@ edo &apos; s speech set here . We in Parliament strongly support the Middle East peace process .
It is , of course , a peace process which is finally under way .
If we think of how the process was looking a year ago , the difference between then and now is like that between night and day , despite difficulties and delays .
I want to emphasise four points . First of all , the Shar@@ m el@@ -S@@ heik@@ h Agreement contains , as everyone knows , a concrete timetable for the implementation of Israel &apos; s commitments .
This applies both to the interim agreement and to the Heb@@ ron and W@@ ye Agre@@ ements . While the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun , I think it is important to keep the two processes apart .
A lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardi@@ se implementation of the three abo@@ ve-@@ mentioned interim agreements .
What we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the har@@ bo@@ urs in Gaza , the northern transit route between Gaza and the West Bank , further releases of political prisoners and implementation of the financial commitments .
The second point relates to Syria . There , the border question is obviously central .
How negotiations are proceed@@ ing there , we still do not know .
What is important , however , is that they have begun .
An important question in this context is the future distribution of water .
As things are at present , the Gol@@ an Hei@@ ghts account for between a third and a sixth of Israel &apos;s water supply .
The third aspect is the peace negotiations in Syria which are closely linked to the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon .
According to UN@@ IF@@ IL , there are now concrete signs that Israel is preparing to withdraw , which is something we welcome .
There too , of course , outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the Leb@@ anese Palestinian refugees .
My last point concerns the future Palestinian State .
This may be proc@@ laimed in the course of this year , with or without Israel &apos; s support .
The Bar@@ ak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party .
Even if negotiations are not completed by September of this year , there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a Palestinian state from being proc@@ laimed after that date .
In this context , it is important for those of us who support the idea of a Palestinian state that the latter should be as Commissioner Patten said , namely a state subject to public control , and that it should be a democratic state .
This is something to which we all want to contribute .
Mr President , I would like to refer , firstly and above all , to the joint resolution which will be laid down to round off this debate .
My Group has made a contribution to this resolution and , need@@ less to say , appro@@ ves of it . More specifically , however , I would like to express our delight at the fact that , after such a long time , Israel and Syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion .
The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East .
It is , therefore , regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being .
Indeed , both parties will need to make huge efforts .
Last@@ ing peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the Israeli borders , as well as Syria &apos; s integrity .
It is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue .
In addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria , I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiations with Lebanon within the fores@@ ee@@ able future and that , in the framework of economic and regional cooperation , a multilateral approach will appear possible .
Nevertheless , it is still regrettable that the European Union , one of the most important financial donors , is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process .
This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of the European Union &apos; s common foreign and security policy .
This is where Mr Solana , the High Representative to the Council , could come into his own .
The Commission and Member States also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region .
I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation .
In this respect , we support Libya &apos; s participation , provided that it recognises human rights , ren@@ oun@@ ces support for terrorists and fully supports the peace process .
There are still , need@@ less to say , many un@@ resolved problems and un@@ answered questions , also involving the Palestinians .
Everyone knows that the peace process is a pro@@ trac@@ ted and difficult affair but we are convinced that , with the necessary trust , per@@ sever@@ ance and indispensable political will , our common goal , namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East , will be achieved .
Mr President , it is pleas@@ ing that , despite certain delays and problems , the peace negotiations are going on both between Israel and Palestine and between Israel and Syria .
The moment of truth is approaching .
Is Israel prepared to comply with the UN &apos; s resolutions and , in exchange for peace and security , hand back the Arab areas which were con@@ qu@@ ered in 1967 ?
Will Israel let Palestinian refugees return or be given compensation ?
Will Israel share Jerusalem and the water of the River Jordan ?
Will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and , therefore , reliable as a partner in peace ?
Will Syria fully accept Israel &apos; s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law ?
The fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occup@@ ying country , Israel , does not prevent the Arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility .
Peace in the Middle East concerns us all , however .
It is therefore good that the EU should act as a go@@ d@@ parent to the Palestinian state .
Against this background , I want to conclude with a remarkable story from Sweden where an international Intergovernmental Conference on Hitler &apos; s ex@@ termination of the Jews is being held , which is obviously a welcome initiative .
Of 47 states invited from all cor@@ ners of the world , not one of them , however , is an Arab state included in the EU &apos; s Barcelona process .
This has been interpreted as indicating that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regarded by Europeans as being similar to the Naz@@ is &apos; anti@@ -S@@ emi@@ tism , which of course is completely incorrect .
The Arab world &apos; s criticism of Israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-@@ col@@ oni@@ alism as , for example , Algeria &apos; s fight for freedom against France .
But today , Egypt , Jordan and Palestine have peace treaties with Israel .
I therefore wonder whether Commissioner Patten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have invited at least one Arab state to the hol@@ oc@@ aust conference in Stockholm .
Mr President , I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to completion .
It is time to end the era which began with the Bal@@ four declaration in 19@@ 17 and the Arab@@ -@@ Israeli war of 1948 . It is time there were secure borders and political , social and economic rights in every country in this region , and that human rights were recognised and uph@@ eld in Syria , Palestine , Israel and everywhere else .
This is an exercise in sovereignty , and in democracy for each population and every individual , but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights , and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given .
I refer princip@@ ally to the Palest@@ in@@ e-@@ Israel question , but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the Gol@@ an since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982 .
Israel has to accept its responsibilities , withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but , at the same time , it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area .
However , Israel is not the only country concerned with security .
The same goes for the other countries , especially for the Palestinians , who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still conf@@ isc@@ ated in areas B and C , despite the Oslo Agreement and subsequent agreements .
Between the period when the Oslo Agreement was signed and 17 October 1999 , 17@@ 4 000 dun@@ ams of land were conf@@ isc@@ ated , 8 4@@ 62 of which have been taken under Mr Bar@@ ak &apos; s Government .
Tre@@ es have been u@@ pro@@ oted , houses are still being demo@@ lished and , above all , water supplies have been reduced or refused , especially in East Jerusalem , while the settlements continue and are growing constantly .
Nevertheless , there is no doubt that with the election of the new government , positive steps have been taken : negotiations , at least , have resumed .
But in the Middle East , there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state , if they cannot move freely within their own territory .
All the international community has to do is implement Resol@@ utions 3@@ 32 , 24@@ 8 , 2@@ 45 and 19@@ 4 .
We are concerned by the de@@ fer@@ ment of the building of relations with Syria , as well as Mr Bar@@ ak &apos; s decision to postp@@ one the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Shar@@ m el ­ -S@@ heik@@ h agreements .
We feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid .
We cannot be content with a role back@@ stage . We must be leading prot@@ agon@@ ists while staying off a col@@ li@@ sion course with the United States , as Minister G@@ ama said .
Mr President , firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comments here today , particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process , and for reaffir@@ ming that our role is not only that of &quot; ban@@ ker &quot; for the entire operation .
I was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria had been suspended .
I very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date .
Nevertheless , we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late .
The fact that the Syri@@ an Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective hi@@ stories is an indication that old hat@@ reds and anim@@ o@@ si@@ ties can be overcome .
Political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East .
I know that if agreement can be reached between Syria and Israel , the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum .
The sett@@ lers at the Gol@@ an Hei@@ ghts will demand to be compens@@ ated and there will have to be guarantees of security .
If Syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the Israel / Syria question might be promising .
On the issue of Palestine , I recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the W@@ ye Agreement .
The key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of re@@ deployment , as well as the transfer of territories .
The low level of releases of Palestinian prisoners and the fact that the Israeli Government appears to intend hal@@ ting implementation of building permits already granted , as well as not appro@@ ving new ones , pose further obstacles .
These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations , although , I believe , these talks will not be held up in@@ definitely .
At present , the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the Palestinians are insi@@ sting that the border issue must be agreed upon first , while the Israeli Government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security .
Currently , both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed .
In conclusion , while other countries in the Middle East have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process , now that the Syri@@ an Government has been brought into the peace process , Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward .
I sincerely hope that , in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East , all the key prot@@ agon@@ ists will move forward quickly , in the very near future , so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved .
Mr President , the various motions for resolutions tabled in Parliament more or less represent the situation in the Middle East .
There are those who are in favour of new agreements between Israel and Syria , but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the Middle East issue .
Indeed , the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability .
The time has come for Israel to fulfil its promises of old and defini@@ tively withdraw from the occupied territories , at last recognis@@ ing once and for all the authority of Palestine , whose resumed diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it is under the wise leadership of Y@@ asser Arafat .
It is equally important not to lose sight of the Iraq question , which no one disc@@ usses anymore , thereby rel@@ eg@@ ating the problems of millions of women , elderly people and children , the victims of an embargo as arro@@ g@@ ant as it is wick@@ ed , to obli@@ vi@@ on .
Mr President , the Israeli author , A@@ mos O@@ z , managed to capture very ap@@ tly the ic@@ y atmosphere at the negotiating table between the Israelis and Syri@@ ans recently .
He was under the impression that the Syri@@ ans thought that , in exchange for the Gol@@ an Hei@@ ghts , all they had to do was to fax the Israelis a receipt .
O@@ z &apos; s impression is also ech@@ o@@ ed in the Israeli press .
It contra@@ sts Prime Minister Bar@@ ak &apos; s personal peace efforts and the distant attitude , even physical absence , of the strong man of Dam@@ as@@ cus , President Ass@@ ad , at the negotiations in the United States .
Sur@@ ely Ass@@ ad would be Bar@@ ak &apos; s ideal negotiating partner and not the Foreign Affairs Minister .
And the Israelis were certainly not impressed by the dis@@ cour@@ te@@ ous behaviour of Minister Far@@ ou@@ k al@@ -S@@ har@@ a in Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ st@@ own .
His behaviour towards Prime Minister E@@ hu@@ d Bar@@ ak was pl@@ ain@@ ly ins@@ ul@@ ting .
But why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic ni@@ ce@@ ties in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory ?
Well , the Syri@@ ans are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face .
At the end of the day , Israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the Gol@@ an .
All the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater European involvement in the peace process .
It is , however , very much in doubt whether Brussels can make available the billions of dollars which the Israeli and Syri@@ an authorities require from their peace pat@@ ron , the United States , not to mention the heavy , equally costly , security guarantees in case of an Israeli withdrawal from the Gol@@ an .
I would like to finish off by asking the European Council and Commission a question . How accurate are the press reports which state that the Portuguese Presidency has already ple@@ dged troops as a peac@@ eke@@ eping force in the Gol@@ an ?
Mr President , the truth is that the news of the in@@ definite suspension or delay of the talks between Syria and Israel is not good news , but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured 16 people .
The suspension of the talks between Syria and Israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the Middle East .
The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authorities and Israel is also suspended at the moment .
After the talks which took place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Le@@ ader of the Palestinian Authority , the Israeli Prime Minister requested a delay of two months as from 13 February , the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Stri@@ p .
What can the European Union do in these circumstances ?
Unfortunately , very little .
It naturally has to support these negotiations , sponsor@@ ed by the United States ; contacts have to be increased ; the presence of the European Union en@@ vo@@ y , Ambass@@ ador Mor@@ at@@ inos , who has fulfilled his mission with great di@@ ligence and efficiency , within the powers of the European Union , is positive .
But none of this hi@@ des the fact that there is a certain sense of im@@ poten@@ ce , because when the negoti@@ ators from each side fly back to the United States this weekend , we will have to remember that , for every 100 dollars spent on the peace process in the region , 60 are contributed by the European Union .
When we consider that a conference will soon be held in Moscow , it becomes clear that the European Union &apos; s presence in this peace process is somewhat pi@@ tiful .
I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a greater role , that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the European Union in this process .
I hope that the forthcoming visit by the President of the European Parliament to the region , as well as the pres@@ idents of the relevant inter@@ parliamentary delegations , will begin an era of greater initiative and a greater presence for the European Union in this complicated and difficult peace process .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner Patten , I should like to thank you for your statements , especially Commissioner Patten , whose analysis I fully share and I shall not , therefore , repeat any of his ideas .
I should just like to make three comments which Commissioner Patten will perhaps see as similar but which , for various reasons , a Member can form@@ ulate more openly .
First , I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian authorities .
But we have enough agreements now : Oslo , W@@ ye Plan@@ tation , Shar@@ m el@@ -S@@ heik@@ h .
We have enough agreements ; they just need to be implemented .
However , in this regard I share Mr Sal@@ af@@ ran@@ ca &apos; s scep@@ ticism when he says that there has been bad news from Israel this week , namely that the Shar@@ m el@@ -S@@ heik@@ h Mem@@ or@@ an@@ dum cannot be implemented within the set tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame .
My second point concerns the resum@@ ption of negotiations between Syria and Israel .
I consider this to be very encouraging news .
But we have also learned this week that Mr Bar@@ ak will not be travelling to Washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued .
I should like to make it quite clear : if the Gol@@ an Hei@@ ghts are returned to Syria , the problem in this region will be solved .
On the question of the referendum which various Members have referred to : we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations .
In Germany , there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay .
That would be a similar situation .
My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union .
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Mor@@ at@@ inos &apos; special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there , Commissioner Patten .
You know that you will always have our support here in Parliament , and that includes your proposal , and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it .
But we must also play a political role and Mr Mor@@ at@@ inos cannot play that role in this region on his own ; the Presidency of the Council must take action , the EU High Representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the Russians did and invite the prot@@ agon@@ ists of the peace process ourselves .
Then we will have played the role which is comm@@ ens@@ ur@@ ate with our participation and our contribution .
Mr President , Commissioner Patten , the recent peace talks begun in the USA between Israel and Syria mark a turning point in the history of the Middle East . It has taken fif@@ ty years to reach this point , which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations .
There will be no meeting today in Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ st@@ own but we must hope , as Mr Patten said just now , that this postp@@ on@@ ement of the negotiations due to Syri@@ an requirements will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the Middle East .
This hope is contained in our motion for a resolution . We hope for a fair and balanced agreement based on respect for sovereign@@ ties and the right to live secur@@ ely within safe and recognised borders .
All the foreign troops , including therefore the Syri@@ an forces , must withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 5@@ 20 of the United Nations Security Council .
D@@ are we hope for an Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon by July 2000 , the date promised by E@@ hu@@ d Bar@@ ak ?
D@@ are we hope for a dual peace agreement between Israel and its neighbours to the north ?
We really hope and believe so .
N@@ ever have the parties been so determined .
One fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from Europe and which must exist between the people . There must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations .
Following the attack in Ha@@ der@@ a on Monday , we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism .
In terms of balance , or should I say im@@ balance , I must add that it is to be reg@@ ret@@ ted that Europe is still playing a minor political role in resolving this conflict .
At mid@@ day , Mr G@@ ama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by Europe to the region .
Despite everything , we are being forced to recognise that the resum@@ ption of the peace process is largely due to the work of Washington .
Like other Arab countries before them , the Syri@@ ans chose the Americans to spons@@ or the negotiations .
This was the choice also made by Israel where Europe suff@@ ers from a parti@@ san public image , and this is a fact , not a jud@@ gement .
This is now the opportunity to reiterate to Mr Patten , Mr Solana and Mr Mor@@ at@@ inos how much we are rel@@ ying on their efforts to include Europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict .
Although it is difficult for Europe to speak with one voice about the peace process , it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity .
The next item is questions to the Council ( B@@ 5-00@@ 40 / 99 ) and the Commission ( B@@ 5-00@@ 41 / 99 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freed@@ oms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , on the 1999 annual debate on the area of freedom , security and justice ( Article 39 of the T@@ EU ) .
Mr President , 1999 was the year of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , of the comm@@ uni@@ ti@@ sation of the Schengen Agreement and of the Extra@@ ordinary Tampere Council .
These have been the most important moments in the Council &apos; s expression of its political will to establish an area of freedom , security and justice in the European Union .
The Council has decided to draw up a charter of citizens &apos; rights - and we re@@ jo@@ ice in this ; it has decided to implement Article 13 of the Treaty , combating all forms of discrimination and xenophobia , and it has decided to approxim@@ ate the laws on conditions for admission and residence , as well as guaranteeing residents treatment which is fair and on an equal footing with the citizens of the Union .
It has also reached a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposals for civil cooperation .
This has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a Community framework .
They have been put into the hands of a single Commissioner , Mr Antonio Vitorino , and we congratulate them on this as well .
Furthermore , they have taken on the task of creating a &quot; sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard &quot; to verify the progress made in this area at Community level , but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the Member States .
We are pleased about this and we congratulate the Council on these decisions , despite the fact that , for this House , the Treaty of Amsterdam included one disappointment : that of del@@ aying , for five years , our role , our ability to participate actively , to democratically control this area of freedom , security and justice , as well as the role taken in it by the Court of Justice .
However , if , on veri@@ fying the progress made during 1999 , which is within the competence of this Parliament in accordance with the Treaty , we leave behind the stage of great declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out , the scene looks considerably dark@@ er , Mr President .
It is as if the Council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to , the other beg@@ ru@@ dges .
Despite all the commitments made at the highest level , the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged .
Programm@@ es multip@@ ly and overl@@ ap and there is no way of as@@ certain@@ ing levels of implementation and effectiveness or , at least , this Parliament is unable to do so .
We have presented the Council with a series of questions and I know that it is the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them .
We hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament .
I said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out .
There are doubts in my Group and doubts also pers@@ ist in this House , for example , about something which should be good news : the incorpor@@ ation of the Schengen Agreement into the Community framework .
Schengen has been incorporated , as we said earlier , into the acquis , but it has been done with very little transparency .
Not a single piece of information , nor a single consultation , has been addressed to Parliament during this process ; neither on the association of the United Kingdom , nor on the incorpor@@ ation of Greece , nor on the negotiations with Norway and Iceland .
The same is true with regard to immigration policy .
We have am@@ used ourselves with a pi@@ le of reports , but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives ; they have disappeared .
We hope that 2000 will be the year for action , in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations .
We hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament .
The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the Union .
The Council can act in accordance with Parliament &apos; s decisions , or it can continue to mis@@ er@@ ably beg@@ ru@@ dge its association with the other institutions in this vit@@ ally important project .
If it choo@@ ses the second approach , it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom , security and justice is built .
Altern@@ atively , it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions , in order to move forward in another way .
Ful@@ fil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit , thus preparing for the future .
Provi@@ de the Commission with the necessary resources and recognition essential for it to carry out its work and for it to verify the real progress made at Community level and at the level of the Member States , and we will be - and the Council will be - able to deal with the decisions made at Tampere and move towards a Union which is fre@@ er , more just and more secure .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is rather moving for me to return to this House in my capacity as a Member of the Council .
So it is with some pride and satisfaction that I find myself here and able to meet up again with some of my colleagues from those days who are still in this House .
We gave an early signal when , before the start of the Portuguese Presidency , we met with the President and Vice-@@ Presidents of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freed@@ oms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs in Brussels .
We were able to invite the Chairman of that committee , Mr Watson , and some members of the committee to come to Lisbon , and to present our views concerning the role of the Portuguese Presidency in this area to them .
And we gave an undertaking then that I now want to repeat formally : during all meetings of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freed@@ oms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , a representative of the Council , at political level , not an official but a political representative of the Council , from one of our &apos; cab@@ in@@ ets &apos; , will always be involved in the work of the committee ...
( Applause )
and whenever the committee thinks fit , and the Chairman requests it , I myself or my colleague , the Minister for Justice , will come to Brussels to take part in the work of the meeting .
We will accordingly give the Chairman of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freed@@ oms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs the pro@@ visi@@ onal agen@@ das for the Council meetings in March and May , to allow contact to be established be@@ foreh@@ and on the subjects to be discussed in the Council . We will do this today .
Furthermore , I would like to say that the Council believes that 1999 was an important year in the field of justice and home affairs .
Cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs was notable for the significant changes w@@ rought by the Treaty of Amsterdam and , as a consequence , for the incorpor@@ ation of Schengen into the Community framework .
The German Presidency had an important task in this respect in achieving the transition from the Maastricht system to the Amsterdam system .
Then there was the launching of Europol soon after the start of the Finnish Presidency , on 1 July 1999 .
There was also a third notable event : the Tampere Summit , a European Council devoted exclusively to justice and home affairs .
The Tampere Summit was marked by a new spirit and by a determination to put the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of the political agenda and to keep it there .
The point that the Portuguese Presidency wishes to reiterate here is that we intend to keep issues connected with the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of the presidency &apos; s political agenda .
As regards our rep@@ lies to Mrs Terr@@ ón i C@@ us@@ í , I shall try to respond to her questions on home affairs , and my colleague will then address the points relating to justice .
As you know , the Schengen acquis applies in full to ten countries , and in the course of 2000 , work will be done with a view to reaching a decision on the acquis coming into force in Denmark , Finland and Sweden , and also in Iceland and Norway .
The Secretary-General of the Council has published a collection of documents covering the entire Schengen acquis , pending publication in the Official Journal once all the translations are available .
This collection is , at present , available in six languages and the remaining translations are near@@ ing completion .
Another issue I wish to raise concerns programmes in the field of immigration and asylum and how they apply to the CE@@ EC@@ s .
In March 1998 , the Council adopted the Od@@ ys@@ se@@ us programme , a programme of training , exchanges and cooperation in the fields of policy on asylum , immigration and crossing of external borders .
It applies to the fifteen Member States of the Union and provides for applicant countries , and possibly third countries also , to be associated with it .
This programme covers the period 1998 to 2002 , and the reference amount for its implementation is EUR 12 million .
Applic@@ ant countries can be associated with projects selected by the management committee as long as this comp@@ lies with the objectives of the programme .
The financial en@@ velop@@ e envisaged for 2000 is EUR 3 million .
Under the 1999 programme , the Commission received 80 applications for finance , tot@@ alling EUR 7.@@ 5 million , against a budget for 1999 of EUR 3 million .
The Commission proposed support for 35 projects , of which 12 were for EUR 50 000 and 23 for amounts over EUR 50 000 .
With regard to the O@@ IS@@ IN programme , and I am now referring to the 1997 budget year , projects were adopted for seminars , training , exchanges of officials , research and studies , and operational actions .
Of 62 projects in all , seven included applicant countries .
As regards SIS , the Schengen Information System , I am pleased to report that the Member States were very positive about its operation and use .
The increase in the number of positive results demonstrates the efficiency of the system and there is a continuing increase in the number of reports .
With a view to developing a customs information system , agreement was reached with the Commission on a system which will permit pro@@ visi@@ onal application of the Convention on the Customs Information System as soon as a certain number of countries have ratified this convention .
Mrs Terr@@ ón i C@@ us@@ í also mentioned an interinstitutional agreement .
I ought to comment on this final point once my colleague , the Minister for Justice , has spoken , but it is obvious that what I shall say is the result of an exchange of impres@@ sions within the Council , and in particular between the two of us .
( Su@@ stained appl@@ ause )
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as I do not have a background as a Member of the European Parliament , you will understand that it is even more moving for me to be here than it is for my colleague Fern@@ ando Gom@@ es .
We are all aware that , to this end , it is essential for the Council to approve , as quickly as possible , the sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard which Commissioner Vitorino has the re@@ mit of establishing . I must stress once again the Portuguese Presidency &apos; s ear@@ n@@ est desire for political agreement to be reached on the sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard at the informal Council in Lisbon on 3 and 4 March .
Tur@@ ning to the specific questions that Mrs Terr@@ ón i C@@ us@@ í has put to us , I shall group them into three basic areas : the fight against organised crime , the operation of the Ju@@ di@@ cial Network , particularly as regards criminal matters , and questions on Europol .
Regarding the fight against organised crime , 1999 marked the implementation of several important actions st@@ em@@ ming from the Vienna action plan , which resulted in the signing of the Charter of European Professional Associ@@ ations , in developments in cooperation and in establishing points of contact between the Member States for receiving information relevant to the fight against money la@@ undering .
And I must not forget the Finnish Presidency &apos; s proposal for a Council decision which is being considered in the Multi-@@ disciplinary Group .
This is an area in which we must carry forward and intensi@@ fy our work , not just by securing approval for the EU strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millenni@@ um , but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the diver@@ gence of views that exists , particularly at Council level , on issues concerning the fight against organised crime .
With this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the French Presidency , with the aim of organising a J@@ umb@@ o J@@ H@@ A-@@ ECO@@ F@@ IN Council .
If this is not to be a mere media event , it will need to be carefully prepared by a joint committee , the composition of which the Portuguese Presidency has already proposed .
Our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime .
Another area is EU involvement in the United Nations Convention against Trans@@ national Organis@@ ed Cri@@ me and its various protocols , and in the conventions being prepared in the framework of the Council of Europe , in particular on cy@@ ber crime .
As this is an issue which has become important in the justice and home affairs programme , the presidency believes that it is worthwhile , bearing in mind the principles of Chapter VI of the Treaty , to explore suitable means of providing the European Parliament with improved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiations under the United Nations Convention .
With regard to the Ju@@ di@@ cial Network , significant progress has been made , in particular the launch at the end of 1999 of the dedicated telecommunications system of the European Ju@@ di@@ cial Network , whilst the Multi-@@ disciplinary Group has developed a series of actions to implement the 1997 action plan .
However , we must stress that it is vital for approval to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millenni@@ um , so as to give a fresh impetus , while preserving continuity , to the work done under the previous action plan .
Still on judicial cooperation , considerable progress has been made on the legal protection of the euro , and the European Parliament is being consulted on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance .
We believe that if legal protection of the euro is to be credible , we must avoid having a multip@@ licity of instruments , and we should accordingly make a combined effort in March to approve a single instrument covering all necessary aspects , including those featuring in initiatives already presented by France and those whose adoption the Commission itself has called for .
It is important in this field to implement measures relating to the mutual recognition of judicial decisions , and we believe that on the basis of work already done , it will be possible , at least in the field of sei@@ z@@ ure of assets , for measures to be adopted in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial decisions .
The French Presidency has passed an important working document to us which sets out various scenarios for addressing and resolving the issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol .
The Portuguese Presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the Eurojust network , since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of Europol to be a matter for Eurojust , this option cannot be ruled out at present .
For this reason , it is essential that the Council &apos; s debates on the future of Europol and Eurojust should be conducted in parallel , so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also .
I believe that in this context , and in the context of the dialogue that the Council and Parliament will have to establish on the future of Europol and Eurojust , it will be possible for us to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the Council and Parliament with regard to Europol .
We are familiar with Parliament &apos; s views and we know that Parliament is aware of the views of the Council &apos; s legal advis@@ ers .
I believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolving the issue of democratic control of Europol , and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all parties involved .
Mr President , Members of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , without wishing to compete with the Ministers as regards emotions , I have to say that I am not moved , rather I am distur@@ bed to have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time , and I just hope that this fact will not alter the separation of powers which is essential for the proper functioning of the Union !
I would also like to thank Mrs Terr@@ ón i C@@ us@@ í for having asked the question which has given rise to the first annual debate of this parliamentary term on the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice , and to thank all the Members who , in their various committees , have actively participated in preparing this annual debate . I would also like to thank the representatives of the national parliaments and of civil society .
In this first speech , I would like to share with Parliament the Commission &apos; s view of the most important events in 1999 .
I believe that I can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that 1999 was both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the Union on issues of freedom , security and justice .
It has already been mentioned that the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force in May and this Parliament stated that the most far-reaching innovation in this Treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom , security and justice .
At the same time , it also represents a qu@@ ant@@ um le@@ ap in qualitative terms , and a logical and vital step in the development of the Union , in the wake of the establishment of the internal market , the introduction of the single currency and the launching of a common foreign and security policy .
This project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common Union .
And it will therefore be necessary to guarantee genuine freedom of movement to all citizens resi@@ ding in the territory of the European Union , recognis@@ ing that this is only meaningful if it is rooted in a secure base , with solid foundations in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have easy access , on equal terms , and in which our citizens can have real confidence .
The Union &apos; s commitment to establishing an area of freedom , security and justice was confirmed at Tampere .
1999 was also marked by the German Presidency &apos; s initiative to draw up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I believe that at the present stage in the European Union &apos; s development , it would be appropriate to bring together the fundamental rights in force at European Union level in a charter , so as to make them as visible and accessible as possible to our citizens .
As I have already said on a number of occasions , I am in favour - the Commission is in favour - of drawing up a charter which would reflect , on the broad@@ est basis possible and as part of a dynamic process , the common constitutional traditions of the Member States and the general principles of Community law , rather than being a mere statement of the lowest common den@@ omin@@ ator .
In my capacity as a representative of the Commission , I will ensure that the charter and the actions st@@ em@@ ming from it represent an affir@@ mation of a Union based on a set of fundamental rights which are an integral part of Europe &apos; s common heritage .
That is the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged European Union in the eyes of every European citizen , an enlarged Europe based on respect for rights and freedoms , with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection , in other words , a Union rooted in the political values which under@@ pin contemporary democracies .
I must not over@@ look the fact that 1999 marked the beginning of the 199@@ 9-@@ 2004 parliamentary term of the European Parliament , that it was the year in which the new Commission took up its duties and , as a consequence , the year in which a Commissioner solely responsible for the areas of justice and home affairs assumed his responsibilities .
In addition to these events , I would like to remind Parliament of some items that were approved in 1999 .
In the field of immigration , borders and asylum , the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on setting up the Eur@@ od@@ ac database , and a proposal for a directive on conditions for ad@@ mitting third country nationals into Member States of the European Union with a view to re@@ un@@ iting families , as part of a vigor@@ ous policy of integrating legal residents in the territory of the European Union .
We also presented a communication on common procedures concerning asylum and a recommendation for a decision author@@ ising the Commission to open negotiations with Iceland and Norway on an agreement designed to extend the rules applied by the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention to those two countries .
The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asyl@@ um and Migration , and ultimately , in December , it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a European refugee fund .
In 1999 , we also presented a communication on victims of crime in the European Union , which led to discussions that were given greater impetus at Tampere . This communication called for minimum standards for protecting the victims of crime , in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to compensation , including the cost of justice .
We also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and for@@ gery of non-@@ cash means of payment .
In the field of European Union legislation on combating financial crime , the Commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money la@@ undering .
In 1999 , the Commission also presented its contribution towards a European action plan to combat drugs , which under@@ p@@ ins the strategy approved by the Helsinki European Council .
For this reason , 2000 will no doubt be a year for testing how the EU &apos; s institutions respond to our citizens &apos; demands for guaranteed freedom of movement , with respect for their rights and guarantees of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection .
In other words , 2000 will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political Union for the next decade - a test for the Council , for Parliament and for the Commission .
It will also , and above all , be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the European Union &apos; s institutions towards the public . It is for the public , therefore , that we are developing the area of freedom , security and justice .
The progress made will not be due to the Commission nor to the Council , nor even to the European Parliament , but to a combination of European institutions and to the Member States themselves , in as much as - as has already been pointed out here - specific tasks on the sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard will be entru@@ sted to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity .
In the coming weeks , I shall be making a tour of capit@@ als to sound out the opinions of the various ministers for justice and home affairs .
I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard project .
And we hope , during the Portuguese Presidency , to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council , taking account of the sound@@ ings that I have just mentioned .
It is my intention that this sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions , and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny .
For this reason , and I believe that this is a challenge we are all facing , I recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the Union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in areas which are essential for citizenship , for leg@@ ality and , ultimately , for democracy itself .
In addition to the sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard , I would like to anticip@@ ate the following initiatives that the Commission intends to present during 2000 - and I would like to emphasise that I am delighted the Portuguese Presidency is treating progress in the area of freedom , security and justice as a priority in its work programme .
I hope that in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation , which is also the political message of Tampere , and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presi@@ dencies .
I also intend to contribute to the process of clari@@ fying the role of action plans as part of the work of the High Level Group on Asyl@@ um and Migration , and to make progress in adapting Community agreements in the field of read@@ mission by including standard clauses .
Furthermore , on the subject of crossing the external borders of Member States , which is a central issue regarding the free movement of persons , I shall , in the next few days , be presenting a proposal for a regulation updating the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold visas for crossing the external borders .
Tur@@ ning to judicial cooperation , in addition to an initiative on the law applicable to non-@@ contractual obligations , I sincerely hope that it will be possible to present to the Council a proposal for minimum standards ensuring an appropriate level of legal aid in cross-border proceedings .
I also intend to continue discussions on the preparation of specific common procedural rules for simpli@@ fying and spe@@ eding up cross-border judicial proceedings relating to small commercial and consumer claims , al@@ im@@ ony claims and non-@@ cont@@ ested claims .
As a follow-up to the Tampere and Helsinki conclusions , the Commission will be presenting its contribution to the preparation of a European Union strategy to combat organised crime .
We will be organising and supporting actions including , in particular , the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters .
The Commission also intends to present specific measures in the field of crime prevention , so as to encourage exchanges of best practice in this area , and in particular the prevention of urban and ju@@ ven@@ ile del@@ inqu@@ ency ; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme financed by the Community for this purpose .
The Commission will also support the presidency &apos; s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money la@@ undering , an emin@@ ently cross-@@ pillar issue .
The Commission will fulfil the re@@ mit given to it at Tampere to present proposals for appro@@ ving definitions , criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings , economic exploitation of immigrants , and sexual exploitation of woman and children , with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication , notably the Internet , for distribut@@ ing child porno@@ graphy .
We are also preparing a communication to ins@@ tig@@ ate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime .
The year 2000 also marks the start of the implementation of the European Union Dru@@ gs Strategy 2000-@@ 2004 .
In this field the Commission , in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament , will give its full support to the Inter@@ institutional Conference to be held on drugs in February .
With regard to Schengen , without wishing to t@@ resp@@ ass on the territory of the Council , or more precisely the incorpor@@ ation of the Schengen acquis into the Community framework , I would like to stress , on the topical subject of restoring border controls , that the Commission wishes to reiterate its willingness to ensure greater control of the application of Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Schengen Convention in order to reinforce its authority .
The recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on Article 62 of the Treaty .
As was emphasised at Tampere , and as part of our preparations for the Fei@@ ra European Council in June 2000 , we will have to prepare a summary of the implications of the new external dimension of justice and home affairs with a view to adopting cross-@@ pillar policy strategies , which strengthen the links between the Union &apos; s internal and external policies in this field and help to uphold the Union &apos; s position on the world stage .
Nevertheless , I must make it clear that all these actions will , of course , have to take into account the principles agreed at the Helsinki European Council concerning applicant countries , so that those applicants can cooperate and also be associated as quickly as possible with this project of creating an area of freedom , security and justice .
Furthermore , it is important to remember that 2000 will see the start of the justice and home affairs negotiations with the first group of applicant countries and I anticip@@ ate that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in preparing the negotiating do@@ ssiers on the second group with which it was agreed to open accession negotiations at Helsinki .
Lastly , I would like to state once again that the Commission intends to be in the pole position in presenting proposals for implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam .
I hope that the Commission and the Council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exerc@@ ising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself .
As I have told Parliament , the task before us is immense and ambitious , and the Commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge .
Mr President , having devoted itself over the last 40 years to establishing a common internal market , the House now faces the major new task of creating an area of freedom , security and justice , a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institutions of the Union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other &apos; s competence .
Commissioner Vitorino , although I would describe cooperation with you as harmon@@ ious and profitable , words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the Council has demonstrated towards us .
It looked , as Mr Schulz once ap@@ tly said in committee , as if the Council understood the area of freedom , security and justice to mean an area in which the Council has free rein , security from Parliament and the right to do and order as it will .
Minister Gom@@ es , I have , of course , heard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency .
I should like to raise three points which for us , as Members of the PPE Group , must be foc@@ al points when such an area is created .
First : a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absor@@ bing refugees must be distributed .
The Council must start by at long last ensuring that EURO@@ DA@@ C is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classi@@ fying asylum seekers .
As far as a European asylum law is concerned , a start was in fact made at Vienna and Tampere .
Unfortunately , however , it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions .
I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union .
Similarly , it cannot be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee mis@@ ery on our continent .
Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda .
Secondly : the introduction of a Europ@@ e-@@ wide fight against organised crime , including by Europol and Eurojust .
The planned introduction of Eurojust is one of our significant successes from Tampere and must now be implemented forth@@ with .
We welcome the fact that Europol has finally been able to start work .
However , the Council should also bear in mind that , if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime , we do not only need to wi@@ den Europol &apos; s re@@ mit , as decided at Tampere ; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its re@@ mit to operational activities .
We are not just calling for more control , and more control over Europol ; our motto here is &quot; L@@ ess is sometimes more ! &quot;
With most of Europol employees currently engaged in self-@@ control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments , we may have a great deal of control , but it is in@@ efficient control .
We want less conf@@ using control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament , without ham@@ per@@ ing the work of Europol .
At the same time , we support the establishment of a European police ac@@ ade@@ my as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction .
Thirdly : the extension to Parliament &apos; s rights in this context .
If the establishment of such an area , in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens , is only decided by diplom@@ ats and bure@@ au@@ cr@@ ats , while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rab@@ bit watching a sn@@ ake , then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens .
There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and , as we have already said , to strengthen the principle of democratic control .
We want an area of freedom , security and justice for the citizens of Europe , not against them .
Mr President , I have nothing further to say to the Council .
The previous speaker has quoted me from the last committee meeting and said it all !
Why does the Council find it so hard to work with us in creating an area of freedom , security and justice ?
I find this question more and more worrying .
Allow me to try and el@@ u@@ ci@@ date it a little from my point of view .
The establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice ho@@ vers at the interface between the constitu@@ ent elements of national sovereignty .
The police and judicial policy are quite clearly elements of sovereignty , in other words sensitive political areas in the Member States , and shi@@ fting the interface of these and comm@@ uni@@ ti@@ sing these policies , i.e. deleg@@ ating powers from the national capit@@ als , from Lisbon , Berlin or Paris , to Brussels represents a transfer of power .
Of course it is very , very difficult to break away from the executive forms which have been handed down to us , even if we recognise that police cooperation is necessary ; we can only fight international crime at European level .
So we have to draw our conclusions and say that we need legal and organis@@ ational comm@@ uni@@ ti@@ sation of the instruments available .
As a result , the governments which need to do this and which recognise that need , also realise that , in implementing this , they are taking away their own powers .
Then there is the European Parliament , which is also complicated .
In the final analysis , however , we must find a way forward , because if we carry on as we have in the past , and with last year &apos; s experience , then what will happen is that the security debate and the debate about citizens &apos; rights will be margin@@ alised in the national parliaments as a result of making it a half national , half European structure .
It has not quite taken off in the European Parliament and the Council meets behind closed doors .
If the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice is kept secret , then we shall not win the citizens over to it .
In other words , the stability of democracy is at stake if we discuss it .
This is why I frequently get so worked up , but not over the Council of Ministers .
Gener@@ ally , they too are elected Members of Parliament : Mr Gom@@ es , Mr Costa , Commissioner Vitorino , in principle we are all in the same boat .
However , I should like to make an appeal to the Council appar@@ at@@ chi@@ ks .
The following principle applies : He who prepar@@ es decisions , in this case the Council appar@@ at@@ chi@@ ks , anticip@@ ates the decisions , which is why the Council appar@@ at@@ chi@@ ks should demonstrate more democratic spirit .
I should just like to mention another aspect briefly because I do not have much time .
S@@ cor@@ ebo@@ ard sounds like sk@@ at@@ ebo@@ ard in German .
I say therefore that we need a timetable which stipul@@ ates what must be implemented , when and by whom .
This Vitorino plan is what we need : clear , precise projects with a clear , defined timetable .
Mr Vitorino , whom I would like to thank for his speech , can give us that , provided that he has the necessary financial and human resources .
Let us give him those resources , then he can get on with his job and we all stand to gain .
I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or je@@ wel@@ s in the cro@@ wn .
I was also encouraged by Commissioner Patten &apos; s comments this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crises .
Perhaps that will end sc@@ and@@ als like the failure of states to deplo@@ y in Kosovo the police they promised .
I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress .
The first is asylum .
It is essential to establish a single European system , but one based on fair@@ ness , full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception conditions , including an end to routine detention .
Dec@@ isi@@ ons on asylum should take months - not years .
The second area is that of freedom : freedom to move and res@@ ide wherever one wishes in the Union ; freedom of information ; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that includes not just Member State citizens but third country nationals .
Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom , not just about repression .
The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems .
Euro@@ scep@@ tics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty , the end of the nation@@ -@@ state , and so on .
But the case of the suspect wanted for ques@@ tioning in connection with the mur@@ ders of three women in France , including British student , Is@@ abel Pe@@ ake , who was thrown off a train , shows why we need mutual recognition .
Ar@@ res@@ ted and released in Madrid , he is now being ex@@ tradi@@ ted after arrest in Lisbon .
Whatever the Euro@@ scep@@ tics say , it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters .
Finally , as has already been said , it is essential , and I hope that the IGC will cover this , to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these areas , with democratic and judicial scrutiny .
Mr President , all I can say about 1999 is this : how wonderful to feel the Portuguese summer after the Finnish winter .
I hope that it works out .
The Tampere Summit was certainly an important mil@@ estone in 1999 for Europe , and for the area of freedom , security and justice in particular .
Num@@ erous questions are still outstanding .
Ans@@ wers are still awa@@ ited .
Since Tampere , there has been an im@@ balance between positive action and mere declarations of intent .
Reg@@ ulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding .
On the other hand , quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life .
The creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future .
However , it is difficult to predic@@ t what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implemented legally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the Union .
The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force .
In Tampere , the question of granting operational powers was discussed .
We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control .
The agreement also attrac@@ ts criticism with regard to EURO@@ DA@@ C .
Parliament has amended the contractual text .
Care must be taken to ensure that the Council comp@@ lies with Parliament &apos; s modus oper@@ an@@ di .
Unfortunately , no initiatives have yet materi@@ alised regarding other matters and we still await them .
Europe as an area of freedom , security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors .
And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe .
Having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers , I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months .
Mr President , Commissioner , the oral question tabled by Mrs Terr@@ ón i C@@ us@@ í shows that this House is taking a firm stance . Indeed , six months after the election of this new Parliament , we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe .
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this .
We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom , security and justice , particularly social justice .
Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their di@@ staste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems .
This is the s@@ ine qu@@ a non condition for re@@ conc@@ iling the popular and political sp@@ heres .
For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fr@@ at@@ ernity , we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged .
A proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the s@@ cour@@ ge which is allowing the rise of racism , xenophobia , nationalism and extre@@ me@@ -@@ right rac@@ ist movements .
We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees .
The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the crimin@@ alisation of asyl@@ um-@@ seekers are no longer acceptable .
All asyl@@ um-@@ seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with susp@@ ens@@ ory effect .
Last week , and somewhat by chance , I witnessed , at Ro@@ iss@@ y airport , a scene of rare violence in which two young women , ad@@ mitt@@ edly illegal immigrants , were being returned to Con@@ ak@@ ry .
They were treated like the worst criminals .
They were stri@@ pped n@@ aked and dra@@ g@@ ged along the floor by their hair , surrounded by a hor@@ de of state security police .
The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbar@@ ic behaviour .
Our role should be to accompany , re@@ assure and assist those who are fle@@ eing dictator@@ ships .
The Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refugees to which Parliament was favour@@ ably dis@@ posed .
Instead of all this waff@@ ling about the budget granted to this fund , we could take the decision to set this up .
The Presidency and the Council can realise what was in@@ comprehen@@ sibly rejected in Tampere , even though this summit provided an important basis .
Likewise , we cannot simply record the rise in xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action .
The laws against racism must be harmonised .
What direction do you intend to give to Article 13 of the EC Treaty ?
What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women ?
How do you aim to eradic@@ ate hom@@ ophobia , racism and sex@@ ism ?
We must take the best from each of our countries .
When six European countries have granted the right to vote , the President of this House can venture to extend this right to vote , and eligi@@ bility to participate in the municipal and European elections , to all people from outside the Community who have lived in Europe for more than five years .
The regul@@ ar@@ isation of illegal immigrants in certain countries , including your own , must act as an example to others . These illegal immigrants nowadays constitute a ple@@ thor@@ a of vulnerable people at the mer@@ cy of sl@@ um land@@ l@@ ords , an op@@ pressed workforce subject to economic exploitation , ren@@ dering them modern@@ -@@ day sla@@ ves .
In more general terms , this Presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority groups and immigrants .
Im@@ migration is too often a syn@@ onym for in@@ security and violence and purely repressive responses .
How do you intend to make our people understand that , today like always , immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is , and will remain , essential in the context of population ?
What action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asyl@@ um-@@ seekers ?
Mr President , there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security , freedom and justice .
The European Union is an economic power@@ house but we are not in a position to pon@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate when it comes to our treatment of refugees .
The level of racism in our society is ter@@ rif@@ ying .
Ireland , for generations , sent her sons and dau@@ gh@@ ters to places of safety throughout the world , but now when the Cel@@ tic tiger is providing wealth and prosperity beyond our expectations , we are showing a very ug@@ ly side to our character .
Rac@@ ism in Ireland is en@@ demic .
It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time .
We are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up .
There is a willingness but fear per@@ v@@ ades , and to assu@@ age this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union .
Mr President , we take note that the exc@@ us@@ e-@@ making , re@@ tic@@ ent Presidency , which , in recent months , has prevented us from holding a debate such as the one we have been able to hold today , has come to an end .
I totally agree with Mr von Bo@@ et@@ ti@@ cher and Mr Schulz &apos; s remarks , and truly believe that the European Parliament and the Court of Justice need to be more involved in the area of freedom , security and justice , without having to derog@@ ate from their own powers .
Nevertheless , to avoid the custom@@ ary cir@@ cus , which every six months has us in@@ discrimin@@ ately att@@ acking the Presidency of the Council , maybe Parliament should find the courage to undertake inc@@ isi@@ ve political action so that the next Intergovernmental Conference will decide to increase codecision with immediate effect and not wait for another five years .
The two iden@@ tic@@ al-@@ sound@@ ing questions which are under discussion are , of course , under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed by a man@@ tra of the kind which , in recent years , has increasingly transformed politics into a type of ideology - fin@@ e-@@ sound@@ ing , but per@@ ni@@ cious .
And our current EU man@@ tra is AF@@ S@@ J : Area for Freedom , Security and Justice .
Beh@@ ind this lies another ambition on the part of the Commission and of the Council and of the overwhelming majority of this House , namely to introduce such an area .
And who is not in favour of security , freedom and justice ?
The problem is just that this is not something the EU can introduce by means of legislative decre@@ es and other supran@@ ational resolutions .
Freedom , security and justice are the root system of any society , reflecting its history , corporate experience and political development .
A system of this kind is not something the EU can introduce without society &apos; s su@@ sta@@ ining damage as a result .
But it is precisely here that we find the real r@@ ationale behind the man@@ tra concerning security , freedom and justice .
The agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen .
That is already secured by means of the various national legal systems .
The agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society &apos; s criminal law , policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU &apos; s control .
It is concerned with increased integration which , as part of a duplic@@ it@@ ous package , involves increased repression and control .
You just have to think of all the resolutions concerning Fort Europa , Schengen , Eur@@ od@@ ac etc . Any democ@@ rat can spot two key problems .
First of all , the initiatives which have been planned are completely un@@ realistic .
How is it envisaged that the EU &apos; s institutions , which are already stret@@ ched well beyond their capacity , can bring the ambitious projects concerned to fru@@ ition ?
Th@@ ink of last year &apos; s de@@ adly criticism of the Commission &apos; s lack of propri@@ ety , ethics and accountability .
It also , of course , finds indirect expression in the question .
But , secondly , the projects will put a stra@@ in on , indeed will be inj@@ uri@@ ous to , the national democracies .
As long as the EU revol@@ ved around the internal market , only the body was being attacked .
Now , it is the soul .
Mr President , today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange ir@@ ony .
We had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom , security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon , which has been accepted , will do away with the Royal Ul@@ ster Con@@ stab@@ ul@@ ary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists .
The IR@@ A terrorists have not given up any of their weapons , nor have the loy@@ alist terrorists , yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community .
Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed .
In 1998 , we had 55 mur@@ ders .
In 1999 , we had 7 mur@@ ders and that does not include the O@@ ma@@ gh bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured .
Between 1998 and 1999 , loy@@ alists ass@@ aul@@ ted and shot 12@@ 3 people , while re@@ public@@ ans ass@@ aul@@ ted and shot 93 people .
Char@@ ges brought against loy@@ alists in 1999 tot@@ alled 19@@ 3 , while those against re@@ public@@ ans tot@@ alled 97 .
Since January 2000 , there have been six sho@@ ot@@ ings by loy@@ alists and two by re@@ public@@ ans , loy@@ alists have been involved in six serious ass@@ aults , one leading to another murder , while re@@ public@@ ans have engaged in five serious ass@@ aults .
Mr President , that situation cannot continue and needs rem@@ ed@@ ying .
Mr President , the Treaty of Amsterdam has set an important objective for the Union .
This is a task which all MEPs , the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislat@@ ure : the creation , as has been said already , of an area of freedom , security and justice .
The Tampere Council , the motor and architect of this objective , has proposed certain goals , but five years , the time scale laid down for the implementation of Chapter IV of the Treaty , is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require .
My first point is that Parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed , especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens , as the Commissioner has explained very well .
My second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system , adopting common procedural rules and , above all , putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons .
The recent laws on ali@@ ens adopted in my country , Spain , and in Belgium , are a remin@@ der that there is an urgent need for the comm@@ uni@@ ti@@ sation of immigration policy .
My third and final point relates to the external activities of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum .
We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an av@@ al@@ anche of refugees and economic migrants .
We must opt for a policy of co@@ operating in the development of our neighbouring countries in the East and the Mediterranean area , but we must do so with rig@@ our , with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions , which must cooperate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are violated or who wish to emi@@ gr@@ ate in order to meet their most essential needs .
Finally , in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship .
The Euro , employment , even security , are not enough .
They need a &apos; European soul &apos; , as a distinguished Spanish professor once said .
Mr President , unlike some of the previous speakers , I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino .
This tri@@ o &apos;s words were like music to our ears as Mr C@@ ey@@ h@@ un has said .
As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly or@@ chest@@ rated .
Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months .
The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune .
As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards dro@@ w@@ ning out some of the un@@ pleasant tun@@ es we heard during the European election and over the last few months .
The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom , security and justice in the European Union .
One area though is extremely important , and this House must be involved in it : namely scrutiny .
There is so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrut@@ in@@ ised , that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of everything involved in it .
And we must make certain that the details are applicable , appropriate and relevant to the different countries .
I should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon , one or two of which were referred to earlier on .
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime .
That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about .
But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have reservations about the Eur@@ od@@ ac system , for example .
We accept the pre@@ dominant role of the Council in this , but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliament@@ arians here when they go through it in more detail .
Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of &apos; sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard &apos; .
Anyone who is English or British or follows cri@@ cket knows what a sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard is .
A sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard tells people the score ; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible .
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so .
At the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening .
Mr President , I would like to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Justice Ministry , Mr Costa , and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in Lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed .
Amsterdam and Tampere have given us much work to do together , as the excellent draft resolution by Mrs Terr@@ ón today shows .
I would like to make three brief points .
The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament .
It is barely six months since Amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together ; we have been si@@ zing each other up , we have had a few minor sp@@ ats , but we need to work effectively together .
Let us stop the shad@@ ow-@@ box@@ ing .
Let us drop the elabor@@ ate char@@ ades and let us respect the duties that the Treaties impose on us and the tim@@ esc@@ ales allowed for full democratic debate .
In@@ vol@@ ve us please in your discussions on both policy and process .
Let us not pre@@ tend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area .
My second point is that we need a properly resour@@ ced Commission .
We have established a new Director@@ ate-@@ General , yet it has only 70 people all told .
There is an agreement to double this number , but I understand that , so far , not a single new person has arrived .
We are setting the Commission a massive task , not least in the drawing up of the sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard .
The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs .
Finally , on the content of the debate , I welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of its agenda .
All good things come in thre@@ es , especially in our policy area .
Two hundred years ago it was liberty , equality and fr@@ at@@ ernity , and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others .
Now it is freedom , security and justice , and I hope that the current governments of the left will he@@ ed the words of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temp@@ tation to elev@@ ate security , important as it is , above the equally important needs of freedom and justice .
Although the main achievements in the construction of an area of freedom , security and justice should be mentioned , we must remember that there is still room for progress .
The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and comm@@ uni@@ ti@@ sation is incomplete .
The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-@@ establish border controls is a clear illu@@ stration of this .
The decision to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predic@@ t whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic , including all people , whatever their nationality , or excluding some .
The total lack of progress in European citizenship and the political rights of all European residents is to be reg@@ ret@@ ted .
Although action plans established by the high-level working group aim to limit mi@@ grat@@ ory flows in the future , these plans do nothing to improve human rights , civil liber@@ ties and the economic situation in the countries concerned .
We know that read@@ mission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements . Yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of &apos; non-@@ ref@@ ou@@ lement &apos; &#91; no turning back &#93; .
Furthermore , it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consulting Parliament .
However , the main concern remains ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the Council as well as the Commissioner .
I thank them for their statements to the House .
Rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered I would like to deal with one specific topic : the question of drugs and how we tackle the per@@ v@@ asi@@ veness of the drug culture in our societies .
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States .
We already have , on the international side , plans in place to combat drug trafficking , money la@@ undering and so on .
Mr President , I would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which I am entitled to point out , or remind , the representative of the Commission that , in Belgium , the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal ali@@ ens are being leg@@ alised and are to receive permanent right of residence , right to be re@@ united with their families , etc .
This is a Belgian government measure which fli@@ es in the face of the Schengen Treaty .
I lo@@ dged a written complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December .
I would ask him to take this complaint into consideration and inform me , within the fores@@ ee@@ able future , of the steps the Commission will take to pen@@ alise this violation of the Schengen Treaty by the Belgian State , in accordance with Article 2@@ 26 of the Treaty .
Mr President , est@@ e@@ emed gentlemen from Portugal , especially the Council representatives , you face great expectations on our part .
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment .
I refer to Eur@@ od@@ ac .
You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eur@@ od@@ ac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system , as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications , in order to have an instrument to fight illeg@@ ality and , above all , in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure .
We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument , together with an implementation committee , which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be .
We were of the opinion that EURO@@ DA@@ C was becoming a reality .
Even in Tampere , we were of the opinion that Eur@@ od@@ ac was becoming a reality .
However , the Council then took another direction at the very next summit in December and took a huge step back@@ wards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected , i.e. that the Council should continue to be responsible for implementation , that the regulatory committee would be attached to the Council and that , where possible , Gibraltar would still be used to exert pressure .
This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see .
My urgent request on behalf of the Group is that you do everything to ensure that Eur@@ od@@ ac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illeg@@ ality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures .
If you tell us today how you wish to proceed , you will be doing us a great service .
Mr President , Ministers , Commissioner , the 1999 harv@@ est of decisions was indeed rich , so much so that it became difficult to gather , i.e. to put those decisions into practice .
I refer in particular to the Council and to the iner@@ tia of the Member States in implementing the decisions they had jointly made .
Without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made , we , the European Parliament , would like to draw your attention to the un@@ willingness on the part of the Council to implement these decisions in many areas , as well as its lack of common vision and , in particular , the lack of transparency and cooperation with the European Parliament .
From what I have said , it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of ob@@ server .
Neither will it stop raising vital issues . For example , how much progress are you willing to make and what measures , legislative or otherwise , will you be taking to combat the s@@ cour@@ ge of trafficking in human beings , child porno@@ graphy on the Internet , drugs , and organised crime ?
Do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration ?
How do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the Community , re@@ un@@ iting them with their families and recognis@@ ing their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of Europe ?
In light of this new international demographic class portra@@ yed by experts at the UN , is it not about time you abandoned your traditional , conservative views on refugees and immigrants ?
I have great expectations for the Portuguese Presidency .
Mr President , I welcome much , indeed most , of what has been said in this debate .
But I want to add a word of caution .
There are also courts in Karlsruhe , London , Lisbon , Dublin and Edinburgh .
We must make sure that what we do makes clear sense .
We must not generate a confusion and conflict of juris@@ dic@@ tions about rights , for that would be the enemy of freedom , justice and security .
We need , in short , to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these .
But we must look always to subsidiarity .
Like everybody in this House , I want freedom , justice and security .
I do not want to see these de@@ generate into over-@@ centr@@ alisation , chaos and confusion .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would very quickly like to make one point .
Various Members raised questions about the Portuguese Presidency .
The President of Parliament has made us aware of the very limited time at our disposal , and my colleague , the Minister for Justice , and I therefore propose to reply obj@@ ectively to all the questions put here at the parliamentary committee meeting which we shall be attending next week .
( Su@@ stained appl@@ ause )
Thank you , Minister .
The debate is closed .
Mr President , I am grateful for the Council &apos; s oral , and also written , reply .
Their efficiency has been truly remarkable .
I will save a few seconds because I wanted to propose to the Council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Rights and Freed@@ oms , Justice and Home Affairs . Then we will have the opportunity to comment on these rep@@ lies and to express our concerns to the Commission as well .
Person@@ ally , I am pleased with some of the rep@@ lies , for example , in relation to issues as sensitive as Schengen and the Europol Convention , which we hope will be reviewed , and I am pleased with the words of the Minister for Justice with regard to trying to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities .
I also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control .
Repres@@ ent@@ atives of the Council , within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this Parliament .
I am sure that , with the willingness that you have shown today , the first thing you will do , in this new climate of understanding between us , will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will submit to you .
Question Time ( Council )
The next item is Question Time ( B@@ 5-00@@ 03 / 2000 ) .
We will examine questions to the Council .
Question No 1 by ( H-0@@ 7@@ 80 / 99 ) :
Subject : Con@@ struction of nuclear plant in earthqu@@ ak@@ e-@@ pr@@ one Turkey The two recent earthqu@@ akes in Turkey regi@@ stering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey &apos;s persist@@ ence with the construction of costly nuclear re@@ actors at Ak@@ ku@@ y@@ u , while energy reserves produced by the At@@ at@@ ür@@ k dam@@ s are exported to third countries and the EU sp@@ ends a sli@@ ce of its budget on rep@@ air@@ ing the damage w@@ rought by the earthqu@@ akes .
Turkey &apos;s nuclear plans B which ignore the risks to the population and eco@@ systems of Turkey and the surrounding region B prompt the sus@@ pic@@ ion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey &apos;s political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons , as evi@@ den@@ ced by their attempts to buy re@@ actors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan .
What steps will the Council take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but sp@@ ends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget ?
Mr President , the Council wishes to point out that Turkey is a sign@@ atory to the Convention on Nuclear Safety , the objectives of which should all@@ ay the fears expressed by Mr Sou@@ lad@@ akis .
The convention , as you will be aware , also covers the prevention of accidents which have radi@@ ological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur .
Thank you for your answer .
However , I would just like to add the following . Turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2 % with this unit .
Nevertheless , rum@@ our has it that it plans to buy Can@@ du re@@ actors of the type acquired by Pakistan and India which were used for nuclear weapons .
In this respect , the issue requires closer examination , because the sensitive situation in the Caucasus region could hei@@ gh@@ ten people &apos; s susp@@ ici@@ ons .
My second point concerns the safety of these plants . In areas of high sei@@ sm@@ ic risk , it is not enough just to have secure , earthqu@@ ak@@ e-@@ proof buildings .
Spe@@ aking as an engineer , I can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances .
However , we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation ; it is just not possible .
With this in mind , it goes without saying that nuclear plants a pri@@ ori should not be built in areas pr@@ one to earthqu@@ akes .
In this respect , and because Turkey is situated on the peripher@@ y of the European Union , we should be helping it to become a more secure , peaceful and cooperative country .
That is our role and this is the point of my question .
I recognise the relevance of the arguments that Mr Sou@@ lad@@ akis has put forward .
This is , of course , a highly sensitive issue .
Furthermore , it will be evident that this is a matter that does not only affect Turkey , in view of that country &apos; s proximity to the existing territory of the European Union . It also affects other states neighbouring the EU with which we maintain relations .
We understand your concerns and will certainly take account of them , particularly during the discussions that we will be having with Turkey to define that country &apos; s own pre-@@ accession strategy agenda .
This question will naturally be one of our key concerns , and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account .
Thank you , Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council .
I am sure the President-in-Office of the Council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog .
However , for@@ give me if I am a little scep@@ tical of the reply you have just given me .
I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately .
Will you please therefore undertake , before the next plenary in February , to write and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public , immediately the Council has passed legislation , rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list .
Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information ?
Mr New@@ ton Dun@@ n , I would first like to say that I do not appreciate the kind of personal comments with which you started your second question , and I would be grateful if you could refra@@ in from making such comments in future .
With regard to what you were saying , it makes me think that the criticism lev@@ elled at the Council , apart from being formulated in a very specific way of which we also take note , does not actually refer to the op@@ acity , shall we say , of the legislative process , but rather almost to an excess of transparency .
However , I would like to say , Mr New@@ ton Dun@@ n , that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be un@@ question@@ able .
We have no problem , Mr New@@ ton Dun@@ n , in repe@@ ating this information to you in writing , but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here , because that meets the requirements of the Treaty exactly .
We therefore consider that the General Secret@@ ariat of the Council is at present making available to the public all essential information regarding the Council &apos; s functions as a legislative body .
I do not consider that the Council tried to answer my question .
I did not ask what the Council thought of the proposal which the Commission has still not tabled .
Instead , my question concerns the interpretation in principle of Article 25@@ 5 of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the European Union referred to there ?
I should like to have an answer to that question .
Does the Council consider that , on the basis of Article 25@@ 5 of the Treaty , national legislation on transparency can be regulated , that is to say legislation not relating to the EU &apos; s institutions ?
Mr S@@ j@@ öst@@ edt , the answer that I gave was the only answer possible .
Nevertheless , I would like to say that any interpretation of Article 25@@ 5 of the Treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity .
At the moment , there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this Article , and unless there is such a proposal , we cannot move forward on this matter .
In any event , Article 25@@ 5 does not , at first sight , allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity .
I am , up to a point , concerned about how the Council will fight for the principles contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision-making process .
How is this to be done when , at the same time , the Commission &apos; s proposal - which has been le@@ aked , so the general public is aware of it - says that employees &apos; freedom of thought comes before transparency and that it is not possible to have access to working documents , reports , dra@@ fts etc ?
Does not the Council &apos; s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process ?
Mrs Fra@@ h@@ m , the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last Intergovernmental Conference .
I would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the Community institutions &quot; out@@ wards &quot; , it also applies between the institutions .
By this I mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the Community institutions &apos; work@@ ings which are not accessible to the other institutions , and not only as regards the Commission &apos; s relationship with Parliament , but also as regards the Commission &apos; s relationship with the Council .
As a matter of fact , at the last conference , this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions .
The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference .
The matter is still open .
Gen@@ u@@ ine transparency of the institutions &apos; work@@ ings and the way they are presented throughout Europe is an extremely important issue and one which , in my opinion , needs to be studied again , particularly in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference . We have no doubts about this and we think that the Members taking part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again .
I believe that the Commission &apos; s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function , but I think that there is always room for improvement in this matter .
For our part , we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area .
It is a very important question indeed which Jon@@ as S@@ j@@ öst@@ edt and others have asked .
We have a principle of transparency in Sweden which strength@@ ens democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens , decision makers and authorities .
We are very anx@@ ious indeed that the EU , too , should move in this direction , and this is also stated in the Treaty of Amsterdam .
One or two years ago , Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Lö@@ ö@@ w which is extremely important in this context .
The report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the Member States .
We can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament .
I want to ask the Council if it understands this warning , in view of what we have now seen in the working documents from the Commission .
I listened very carefully to what Mr Sei@@ x@@ as da Costa had to say on transparency and the Intergovernmental Conference .
My concern is , if I have understood Mr Sei@@ x@@ as da Costa correctly on the interesting points he made as regards transparency and the IGC , whether the Portuguese Presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of wi@@ dening the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference .
After all , examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other - though I know full well the importance of these lob@@ bi@@ es .
It should have its own heading in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference , which would mean wi@@ dening the agenda .
Mr Dim@@ it@@ ra@@ kop@@ ou@@ los , transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions .
This Intergovernmental Conference will , at the outset , concentrate on improving the way the institutions operate , particularly taking account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic , more transparent and more efficient .
All of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework - that of the overall accept@@ ability of any solutions we may de@@ vise to achieve these three aims .
It is obvious that transparency will be a permanent fix@@ ture on the European agenda and it will , of course , feature on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference .
I can assure you that this is an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference .
It must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament , who will surely r@@ ally behind this proposal .
We will then see , at minist@@ erial level , how we can follow this up .
It should nevertheless be noted that we have just concluded the Treaty of Amsterdam , which was approved last May , and that there is a raft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in progress . The question is whether it is pre@@ mature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency .
My feeling is that , in spite of everything , this issue will always have to be on the agenda , because the public is clearly concerned about it , and because it is linked with the need to make the European institutions accountable to the public .
As far as we are concerned , they will be .
We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter .
Question No 5 by ( H-0@@ 7@@ 85 / 99 ) :
Subject : Pro@@ pos@@ al for a regulation laying down the total ad@@ missible cat@@ ches for specific fish populations for the year 2000 , and the case of an@@ cho@@ vies in particular The latest reports from the International Council for the Expl@@ oration of the Sea indicate that the current level of an@@ cho@@ vy stocks in IC@@ ES zone V@@ III is critical .
Have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assessed the impact of transferring the Portuguese quota for IC@@ ES zones X@@ I and X and C@@ EC@@ A@@ F zone 3@@ 4.@@ 1.1 to France ( 5000 met@@ ric tonnes per year over@@ fishing ) on the IC@@ ES zone V@@ III an@@ cho@@ vy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the an@@ cho@@ vy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future ?
Does the Council believe that it is per@@ missible to consolidate future over@@ fishing which viol@@ ates the originally established T@@ AC of 33 000 met@@ ric tonnes per year , given the current evidence for the critical state of an@@ cho@@ vy stocks ?
What measures does the Council intend to adopt , and when , with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of an@@ cho@@ vy stocks , the a@@ fores@@ aid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability ?
Mr President , the Portuguese Presidency is extremely anx@@ ious to give a comprehensive answer to this question , particularly because it bro@@ aches an issue which concerns Portugal in a positive way , and I shall explain how .
The Council is aware of the critical level of an@@ cho@@ vy stocks in the Bay of Bis@@ c@@ ay to which Mr Or@@ tu@@ on@@ do Lar@@ rea refers .
Nevertheless , at the last Fisheries Council of 1999 , held on 16 and 17 December , the Member States involved in this area of fishing , namely France , Spain and Portugal , considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a T@@ AC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes , as the Commission proposed , was exc@@ essively cau@@ tious .
A compromise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risks , that is the species of fish being affected , and the socio-economic problems caused by fishing limits . This was achieved by fix@@ ing the T@@ AC at an intermediate level of 16 000 tonnes instead of the 33 000 set in 1999 .
It was also stipul@@ ated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species , of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year .
As for the Southern stocks of an@@ cho@@ vy in IC@@ ES zone IX , the T@@ AC was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999 .
F@@ ishing quota transfers between Portugal and France were reduced propor@@ tionally from 5 00@@ 8 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000 , for fishing in French waters .
I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on an@@ cho@@ vy stocks overall , over the whole Community fishing area .
In accordance with the principle of relative stability , 90 % of stocks of an@@ cho@@ vy in the Bay of Bis@@ c@@ ay are allocated to Spain and only 10 % to France .
Without this transfer from Portuguese waters , the level of the Bay of Bis@@ c@@ ay T@@ AC would have to be multip@@ lied by ten in order to grant adequate cat@@ ches to France .
That is why I think that this is quite positive from Portugal &apos; s point of view .
This situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stocks than the risk referred to by Mr Or@@ tu@@ on@@ do Lar@@ rea , which we also understand .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all .
I understand that Portugal is affected by this .
It has been shown , as we have been claiming since 1995 , that this move is appalling , and , if Portugal and France wish to reach an agreement , that is fine by us , but these an@@ cho@@ vies should be fish@@ ed in Portuguese fishing grounds and not in the Bay of Bis@@ c@@ ay .
Today , scientific studies show that the an@@ cho@@ vy population in the Bay of Bis@@ c@@ ay is in danger of ext@@ inc@@ tion , and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of an@@ cho@@ vy which can be fish@@ ed in that Bay .
I do not know if you are aware , representatives of the Council of Ministers , of your responsibility over these last few years , and in 2000 as well , for the p@@ light of the families who live on an@@ cho@@ vy fishing in the north of the Iber@@ ian Pen@@ ins@@ ular .
The Court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the an@@ cho@@ vy quota allocated to Spain in zone V@@ III had been maintained at 90 % and France &apos; s at 10 % .
Apart from this , Mr Or@@ tu@@ on@@ do Lar@@ rea , the Court is of the opinion that the transfer eff@@ ected between Portugal and France does not viol@@ ate the principle of explo@@ iting living sea and fresh@@ water resources in a rational and responsible way , on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones V@@ III and IX neither increases nor ad@@ ver@@ sely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to Spain .
Accordingly , Mr Or@@ tu@@ on@@ do Lar@@ rea , the Council reiter@@ ates its opinion that without this transfer , greater account would be taken of France &apos; s possibilities for an@@ cho@@ vy fishing in the Bay of Bis@@ c@@ ay .
The Council therefore reiter@@ ates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen .
In concrete terms , 3 000 tonnes represent 5@@ 7.@@ 5 % of Portugal &apos; s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 00@@ 8 tonnes or 7@@ 3.@@ 9 % in 1999 .
These numbers represent , in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council , a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80 % laid down in Council Regulation 6@@ 85 / 95 .
Question No 6 by ( H-0@@ 7@@ 88 / 99 ) :
Subject : Meas@@ ures to combat the continuing ethnic cle@@ ans@@ ing of Ser@@ bs and Rom@@ anies in Kosovo On 2 December 1999 , NATO &apos;s Defence Ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cle@@ ans@@ ing of Kosovo &apos;s minority communities .
In its resolution referring to specific atro@@ cities committed against Ser@@ bs and Rom@@ anies , Parliament also vigor@@ ously condem@@ ns the continuing violence against the Ser@@ b population and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Alb@@ ani@@ ans to fully respect UN Resolution 124@@ 4 .
The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Alb@@ ani@@ ans cannot constitute a pretext for k@@ ill@@ ings , ab@@ duc@@ tions , det@@ en@@ tions , intim@@ id@@ ation , ar@@ son , lo@@ oting , destruction of property and the tak@@ ing-@@ over of houses etc .
In the light of the above , will the Council re@@ consider the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo , as requested by Parliament ?
What other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cle@@ ans@@ ing ?
Mr Ala@@ van@@ os , I would like to say that I have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised .
We genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in Kosovo for ethnic minorities , for both the Ser@@ b and Rom@@ any populations , and the incidents of discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment and intim@@ id@@ ation which continue to take place in that region .
The Council has always stressed the need to seek prosec@@ ution of all those who have perpet@@ rated such acts and of those who continue to perpet@@ rate such acts .
The Council once again reiter@@ ated the need , in its December conclusions , to fully implement Security Council resolution 12 / 99 and has consistently supported Bern@@ ard K@@ ou@@ chner &apos; s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and , in particular , to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region &apos; s multi-@@ ethnic ma@@ ke-@@ up are effectively implemented .
In our contacts with senior political figures amongst the Kosovo Alb@@ ani@@ ans , we have stressed - and the Portuguese Prime Minister did this very recently - that persecution of the Ser@@ b population , the Rom@@ any population and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable .
It will not be toler@@ ated , and must stop immediately .
It has been communic@@ ated explicitly and repeatedly to Koso@@ var leaders that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non-@@ Alb@@ anian minorities are treated .
I think that this is an extremely important point : this sense of condi@@ tionality , which under@@ lies the European Union &apos; s position , is being maintained by the Council and will continue to be maintained .
We have fully supported the efforts of the United Nations mission and the international security forces in Kosovo to prevent further out@@ breaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat .
K@@ FOR and the UN@@ M@@ IC police consider one of their two main tasks to be preventing any form of mal@@ treatment on the grounds of a person &apos; s ethnic origin .
The Council therefore expressed its satisfaction , in its December conclusions , at the substantial contributions announced by the European Commission , which will indirectly assist in returning the situation to normal , together with similar contributions made by Member States .
Nevertheless , Mr Ala@@ van@@ os , the Council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organisations in Kosovo does not match the desired amount , in terms of what the various Member States have been able to raise , and this has limited the real ability of these organisations to act on the ground .
We shall nevertheless continue to devote all our attention to this problem because the entire credibility of the authorities and of the organisations representing Alb@@ ani@@ ans in the region also depends on the ability of these organisations to prove themselves capable of implementing measures which will guarantee the region &apos; s multi-@@ ethnic nature .
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council .
I believe - as I think we all do - that Portugal , its former president , Mr So@@ ares , and its government , maintained a cau@@ tious and mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ of-the-@@ road stance during the bom@@ b@@ ings in the Balkans .
Today &apos; s political statement on this issue was very positive indeed , and one which I welcome .
However , there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the European Union .
Unfortunately , we have recently witnessed the eradic@@ ation of Ser@@ b , Rom@@ any , Turkish , and Croatian minorities in Kosovo and we are now wonder@@ ing what will happen next .
The United Nation &apos; s , and Mr K@@ ou@@ chner &apos; s , mission in Kosovo ended in failure .
This failure is illustr@@ ated by the fact that after an entire war that was w@@ aged to put an end to ethnic cle@@ ans@@ ing , we now have ethnic cle@@ ans@@ ing from the opposite side .
And so I would like to repeat my question as to whether the Council intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with Mr K@@ ou@@ chner , who has a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today .
Mr Ala@@ van@@ os , I cannot agree with what you just said in your last sentence on Mr K@@ ou@@ chner &apos; s responsibilities , and I would like to make two very important points here . The structure being implemented in Kosovo is under the au@@ sp@@ ices of the United Nations .
It is a structure to which the European Union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the European Union have contributed in various ways .
There is one thing , however , that we cannot deny , and that is that Mr K@@ ou@@ chner &apos; s efforts to return Kosovo &apos; s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive .
This is unden@@ i@@ able , even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the results of these efforts , for reasons beyond Mr K@@ ou@@ chner &apos; s control , have not been as effective as we would all have liked them to be .
I have one last point to make , which is about the European Union &apos; s responsibility and , specifically , in this case , about possible action by the Council in this matter , and the responsibility of the international community , which has overall responsibility for the situation in Kosovo .
Therefore , the responsibility of the European Union has to be seen in a certain context .
It is the international community , and specifically the United Nations , which should be held responsible for implementing Resolution 12 / 99 and , in particular , for the thinking behind this resolution and for the compatibility of this resolution with reality .
These are questions which we should all be asking , but the forum for putting these questions is the United Nations .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I hear@@ ti@@ ly welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures , in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities .
I think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public .
The question which I therefore ask myself is this : has in fact a start been made on how we can promote the media in this area , how we can train journalists and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful co@@ existence ?
We have endeav@@ oured to provide material help .
We have tried to defend peace by taking military action .
What is the situation now as regards efforts to include psychological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here ?
Mr Rü@@ big , as I said , I understand your concerns very well .
I think that , at the moment , particularly in the last few months , there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to Mr K@@ ou@@ chner , in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently .
I heard Mr K@@ ou@@ chner speak at the Council of Europe minist@@ erial meeting on this issue , and I think that many of the concerns he expressed then about the lack of resources needed to overcome some of the problems have now been addressed . In other words , he has been given these resources .
Firstly , an increase in police numbers would be an important factor in guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population and , in particular , in protecting certain sections of the civilian population . Secondly , an increase in appropriations would allow some officials who have important roles in the administrative and operational process in Kosovo to be kept on .
The issue which we should all raise , and I did so myself , in a diplomatic way , a while ago , concerns the very substance of Security Council Resolution 12 / 99 .
I know that this is an extremely delicate issue , but we should all be ques@@ tioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented .
We advocate that it should be implemented in its enti@@ re@@ ty .
What we have to do , and we in the European Union are already doing it , is to guarantee Mr K@@ ou@@ chner all the necessary resources , and you are right , Mr Rü@@ big , we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used .
We in the Council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency .
Mr Sei@@ x@@ as da Costa , I totally agree with you .
The problem is not Mr K@@ ou@@ chner but the legal basis on which he is working , namely Resolution 124@@ 4 .
Having said this , the EU &apos; s responsibility , which is both yours and ours , is to try and move beyond the pro@@ visi@@ onal nature of Resolution 124@@ 4 and de@@ vise a future scenario for the whole region .
It is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the exc@@ esses , accidents and assass@@ inations mentioned by Mr Ala@@ van@@ os .
Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo ?
If so , does it intend to do so within a general re@@ definition of the region , avoiding as far as possible the multip@@ lication of micro-@@ States , as has t@@ ended to happen elsewhere , and re@@ un@@ iting the parties , in this case Kosovo and Albania ?
Since the author is not present , Question No 7 lap@@ ses .
Question No 8 by ( H-0@@ 7@@ 96 / 99 ) :
Subject : New INTER@@ RE@@ G Initiative In point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft Communication on INTER@@ RE@@ G entitled : Pro@@ motion of urban , rural and coastal development , the Commission author@@ ises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy .
However , housing is specifically excluded .
Given the fact that there are many houses in rural areas which are of historic interest , including small cot@@ tages , and , given the need , for a variety of reasons , to maintain rural populations and to attract people to rural areas , does not the Council agree that these objectives could be assisted if housing projects were funded in the areas covered by INTER@@ RE@@ G ?
Mr President , the Council and , I think , the Portuguese Presidency in particular , are extremely aware of the importance of the problems Mr Gall@@ a@@ gher &apos; s question raises and I would like to say that we have always paid the utmost attention to Community policies for the development of rural areas .
I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development . This was , as you know , one of the changes made during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at Community level .
Through the European Agri@@ cultural Guar@@ ant@@ ee and Gu@@ idance Fund , the E@@ AG@@ G@@ F , this Community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of aband@@ oning rural areas , an issue you are quite right to raise .
On the other hand , the European Regional Development Fund , the ER@@ DF , also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion , by red@@ res@@ sing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion .
In this regard , we should bear in mind that the ER@@ DF also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas .
This combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today , furthermore , is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy - in one of its dimensions - and regional policy also , have developed and changed .
We think that this is one of the most fundamental issues within the concept of multi@@ functionality which is now associated with changes in the common agricultural policy , and the E@@ AG@@ G@@ F , of course , has a crucial role to play in this .
Question No 9 by ( H-0@@ 7@@ 98 / 99 ) :
Subject : Far@@ ming and the Portuguese Presidency Will the Council outline the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency for the next six months as regards the common agricultural policy and indicate the steps it feels are necessary to boost consumer confidence in the agricultural sectors and products ad@@ ver@@ sely affected by recent health scar@@ es ?
Your question on the common agricultural policy is one which we take very seriously and which should always be considered in this House &apos; s discussions , because in the future we are likely to discuss this issue at great length .
During the Portuguese Presidency , we will be continuing discussions on the CAP , by adapting some of the common market organisations with a view to developing the Union &apos; s rural areas in an appropriate way and guaranteeing an improvement in farmers &apos; incomes , paying particular attention to measures which could have an impact on small family-run farms .
On the other hand , the Portuguese Presidency will continue , if and when the new WTO round begins within its term of office , which is by no means guaranteed , to ensure that the presence of Community production on international markets is strengthened . It will also continue to ensure a greater balance between exported Community farm products and preserving the multi@@ functional European agriculture to which I have just referred .
The Portuguese Presidency also att@@ aches importance to rein@@ forcing food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President-in-Office already referred to this aspect this morning .
We think that the role of food safety , specifically in terms of everything linked to public health , is one of our presidency &apos; s essential tasks .
It is therefore one of the priorities of our programme .
We shall be developing it in four parallel schemes , in the Agriculture Council , the Health Council , the Consumer Affairs Council and the Internal Market Council .
At the Santa Maria da Fei@@ ra European Council meeting in June , the Portuguese Presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the Commission presented in its White Paper a few days ago .
We think that the task we now have of establishing a European agency is crucial in order to give credibility to the single market , to stabili@@ se confidence in this market , to break down some of the tensions between Member States in this area and even - it has to be said - to give the European Union a common approach for its deal@@ ings with third countries in areas of food safety .
This is what we shall be trying to achieve during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope , at the end of it , to be able to present the result of our efforts to this House .
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply .
I am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat to the European model which is based on family farming , mainly those farmers involved in beef and she@@ ep@@ meat production who are now expected to sell their produce at or below production costs .
I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks , in particular , against the ran@@ ch and fac@@ tor@@ y-@@ style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where , of course , European standards of food safety do not apply .
I completely understand your concerns , and I feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the European Union itself on this issue .
We also have to think of the consequences , especially in terms of financing and compens@@ ating farmers .
Nevertheless , as you know , this issue is now in the hands of the European Commission and it will have to take this further .
The Council &apos; s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited .
Mr President , I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber .
But I do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling hom@@ eless@@ ness and housing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisations actively involved in this field .
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-@@ disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to hom@@ eless@@ ness and include the problem of drug dependency .
My specific question concerns the problem of hom@@ eless@@ ness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office all@@ u@@ ded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level .
I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role , even if only in providing the con@@ du@@ it for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States .
Mr Crow@@ ley , with regard to the presidency &apos; s scope for supporting actions by non-governmental organisations , particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the hom@@ eless , I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome , and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them .
We have worked closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency , which we are combining with the wide range of concerns under@@ p@@ inning our whole programme .
We have no specific , concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by NGOs in this area might be considered during our presidency .
It should be pointed out that this can only be done within the Council &apos; s scope for action .
Any aspect of this which may imp@@ inge on the Commission &apos; s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the Commission itself .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you have talked a lot about the future , about what the Commission will do , and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon , etc . However , you also said something which I find particularly fri@@ gh@@ tening .
You said that in Lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development .
I am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead , partially at least , to exclusion .
I do not see how you could , with the views that you hold , provide any answers .
What I asked and what I am once again asking is the following : what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on , for example , the appe@@ als made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion , the division of work and social security , the implementation of tax policies , particularly for spec@@ ulative capital , and the policy of re@@ distribut@@ ing wealth ?
I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intends to do something about these matters .
You must understand that a presidency &apos; s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited .
I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission &apos; s own scope for interven@@ ing , through its right of initiative .
The second is to create internationally competitive conditions , which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the European Union , and this will have positive kno@@ ck-@@ on effects on the problems of social exclusion .
The Portuguese Presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can , in six months , resolve problems that have always existed .
It is prepared to act on proposals by the Commission in any area for which there is Community competence . It also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented , specifically by non-governmental organisations , but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters .
We should , however , also bear in mind , Mr Pap@@ ay@@ ann@@ akis , that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact , armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months .
We therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long-term strategies , regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term , some of the hom@@ eless may be dead , will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the European Union .
We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency .
Question No 12 by ( H-0@@ 8@@ 01 / 99 ) :
Subject : Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy , the Convention of Lom@@ é and tackling fam@@ ine situations ?
I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question , and indeed the Minister who spoke to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels out@@ lining the position .
But there are some questions still outstanding .
There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme .
The situation of AIDS in Africa now is so serious that more people are dying of AIDS than are dying in conflict .
I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue .
Medic@@ ines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa .
I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethi@@ opia where there is d@@ rought , where the crops have failed , and where , in six months &apos; time , we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in Ethi@@ opia with fam@@ ine and people dying in their thousands .
At the same time , there is a war going on between Er@@ it@@ rea and Ethi@@ opia and the arm@@ aments industry in Europe is not short in sending g@@ uns , after which we will send the bread .
First of all , Mr Andre@@ ws , you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague &apos; s speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development .
There is no contradiction between our two positions , quite the opposite .
Unless we wish to act like meg@@ al@@ om@@ ani@@ ac@@ s , we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaus@@ tive inventory of all possible and imag@@ inary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face , particularly in the area of external relations .
As you can understand , it would be easy to do so .
All we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme , one after the other .
We are sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within governments &apos; ability to act and within the scope of the Council .
We must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve , particularly in terms of managing national indic@@ ative programmes .
You have mentioned Ethi@@ opia , which falls within the scope of national indic@@ ative programmes , but there are , as you know , several Community actions to combat AIDS , and in this respect , you are right , and the United States will probably not do any better .
Indeed , in terms of development aid policy , I think that Europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compar@@ es very favour@@ ably with that of the United States .
Your question swit@@ ched to the subject of arms , a broader policy issue which I do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the Council will , of course , address in the future , if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context .
Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the EU to developing countries at prices below the cost of production ?
Does the presidency intend to do anything about this ?
Since the author is not present , Question No 13 lap@@ ses .
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council , and I would personally like to welcome him and the Portuguese Presidency .
Please allow me to remark on how well-@@ vers@@ ed and well-@@ informed he is on European affairs .
Unfortunately , in my case , he did not provide what I would call a satisfactory answer .
Since the Council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset , it should , in my view , demonstrate this in practice .
S@@ aying that the cultural dimension is governed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is , I am afraid , just an excuse .
My question , which has not been answered , is why , when the European Parliament is looking to increase appropriations to fund cultural programmes within the European Union , the Council and the Commission are cutting back on appropriations and at times cutting them out altogether .
This is a true example of the Council &apos; s in@@ difference towards culture , despite its ass@@ ur@@ ances to the contrary that it is a matter to which it att@@ aches great importance .
I would therefore like to ask the Council if it is prepared hen@@ ce@@ forth to support culture with the same read@@ iness as it supported ban@@ anas , h@@ ops , co@@ ws and Indian hem@@ p .
Mr Mar@@ inos , we are not adopting a purely economic approach to managing the Portuguese Presidency , and therefore , the cultural dimension is , I am sure you will appreciate , one of our main concerns .
These cultural dimensions , however , almost always have their own economic dimension in turn , that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives .
This is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the European Union , and especially within the framework of the Council .
For our part , we shall be attempting to strengthen and consolidate the European position on cultural goods and services and on activities in this sphere , because we believe that this is an identifying feature which is crucial to the Union &apos; s image and to the Union &apos; s own particular identity .
This is , and will continue to be , connected with developments within the World Trade Organisation .
As you know , both we and the Council have addressed this issue appropriately . In specific terms , we have been able to find a common language in terms of the mandate given to the Commission for the next round of WTO negotiations , at which this will be a central issue .
Nevertheless , I would like to add that with regard to cultural policy , and in particular the audiovisual dimension , the Portuguese Presidency will be paying very close attention to extending and enrich@@ ing European audiovisual policy by adopting a Medi@@ a-@@ Plus programme which could go some way towards all@@ aying Europe &apos; s main fears .
We also intend to initiate a new debate , a more innovative one , on the issue of Europe &apos; s film heritage , given that this must be one of the most important factors in the development of a European cultural identity and of a European audiovisual economy .
The Presidency will also concentrate on discussions about creating a digital television system in Europe , which will be the subject of a conference that we shall be organising during the Portuguese Presidency , in conjunction with the Commission , in February 2000 .
But , Mr Mar@@ inos , in the EU context , culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with IGC agen@@ das .
If , by chance , it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , then this could be suggested , both by Member States , and by the Members of the European Parliament taking part in the preparatory group .
Of course , if consensus could be reached on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference , there might eventually be progress .
It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this .
We will soon see , and for our part , we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue .
Mr President , I join others in wishing Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency .
I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it , you would consider it .
Well , I , and my fellow 35 British Conserv@@ ative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it .
I appreciate that it is a pro@@ voc@@ ative question .
It is meant to provo@@ ke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves .
We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can re@@ connect with our citizens .
I cannot think of a better way to do it .
Can you ?
The issue is whether the European dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the Treaties .
This is an issue which , as you will understand , will have to be addressed at IGC level and is an issue that only a Special European Council can author@@ ise the Portuguese Presidency to pursue , because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take place .
Intergovernmental Con@@ fer@@ ences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree .
It is therefore not out of the question that these issues , which crop up again and again , and which are passed from one conference to another , may be addressed .
The problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the European Union on this issue being included , particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included , other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference &apos; s agenda .
Mr Dim@@ it@@ ra@@ kop@@ ou@@ los has the floor for a procedural motion .
I would ask him to be brief .
Mr President , I understand that I have to do this very quickly .
I liked what Mr Sei@@ x@@ as da Costa said about Father Christmas .
In Spain they say a letter to the three k@@ ings .
I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent a letter to the three k@@ ings through its reports .
Now the Presidency and the Council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three k@@ ings .
As I susp@@ ected , it was not exactly a procedural motion , but more a closing of the debate .
We thank Mr Sei@@ x@@ as da Costa , but he can also write his letter to the three k@@ ings .
I would merely say that the fes@@ tive issue which Mr Dim@@ it@@ ra@@ kop@@ ou@@ los has raised is an extremely important one .
The problem is that in this case Father Christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so .
It is not the Portuguese Presidency &apos; s job to hand out the presents that everyone wants , especially those that the European Parliament is asking for .
After this interesting exchange of opinions , and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure , I would like to tell you that Questions Nos 17 to 27 will be rep@@ lied to in writing .
That concludes questions to the Council .
Capital tax
The next item is the joint debate on :
the oral question ( B@@ 5-00@@ 04 / 2000 ) by Mr Dé@@ si@@ r and others , to the Council , on the Council position on the idea of a capital tax
the oral question ( B@@ 5-00@@ 05 / 2000 ) by Mr Dé@@ si@@ r and others , to the Commission , on the Commission position on the idea of a capital tax .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , during the Asian crisis in 1997 , as with those which hit Mexico in 1995 or the EM@@ S in 1993 , everyone could see the damage caused to the economies of entire countries by financial speculation , particularly currency speculation .
Between EUR 1 500 and 2 000 billion are tra@@ ded every day on the financial markets . In three or four days , this can equal the total figure of annual global production , or global GDP , of approximately EUR 6 000 billion .
The bulk of these financial transactions are purely spec@@ ulative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments .
Yet the er@@ ratic movement of these massive sums of capital can , in a few hours , cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country , pl@@ ung@@ ing its whole population into recession .
In view of this situation , renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by James Tob@@ in , winner of the Nobel Prize for Econom@@ ics , to create a tax on currency transactions . The rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments , but it would act as a light bra@@ ke on the wheels of speculation , thereby checking the multip@@ lication of short-term transactions .
Note that this proposed tax , which seems to be producing strong emotions in some people , would be the lowest tax in the world and the lowest in the history of global taxation . Yet it would represent the rec@@ ap@@ ture of the areas sei@@ zed from democracy by the financial sphere .
One reason for the acceptance of this proposal , and of the campaigns by NGOs such as AT@@ T@@ AC , SOL@@ ID@@ AR or others which have popul@@ ar@@ ised this proposal , is that it would release resources which could be allocated to development programmes in the poorest countries , in areas such as education or health .
It could act as a kind of asset re@@ distribution in a world where there is both increasing wealth and increasing poverty .
Many person@@ alities and institutions have come out in favour of this tax such as the Brazilian President , Fern@@ ando Car@@ do@@ so , the Finnish Government , the Canadian Parliament last March and also Li@@ on@@ el Jo@@ sp@@ in in 1995 .
This question has been debated in several national parliaments of the EU .
The common response has been that this tax could not be applied solely at national level and that the right platform for tackling this is the European Union . This is the reason for the oral question to the Council and Commission which we have tabled with 37 other Members .
The motion also asks that a position document , drawn up by the Commission and Council , should be submitted before the next annual meeting of the IMF .
The European Union must take the initiative and must also , as demanded in the motion , propose this initiative to the G@@ 7 because it is primarily a political question .
If the Union takes the initiative , this will have a rat@@ ch@@ et effect because this debate is occurring all over the world , including in the USA and Japan . A desire is being expressed everywhere with increasing force that the world should not be ruled by tra@@ ders but by the people , their parliaments , their governments and their democratic institutions .
Europe must play a role in this new international regulation and I am extremely happy that today , with this debate and this motion , this question is now on the agenda of European construction .
Madam President , I do not have a great deal to add on this subject .
The Council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as Professor Tob@@ in suggested .
This is a creative initiative , which we know has been welcomed by different industries across the world and by various sides in European politics , but the Commission has not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue .
As it falls to the Commission to propose any such initiative , the Council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue .
Madam President , the revenue basis of the Tob@@ in tax is said to be made up of very short-term exchange transactions .
Such transactions , according to the argument , bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables .
This has also just been under@@ lined by Mr Dé@@ si@@ r .
Therefore , according to prop@@ on@@ ents , such as Mr Dé@@ si@@ r , an internationally applied Tob@@ in tax would , in principle , reduce spec@@ ulative transactions and , hence , the vol@@ atility of exchange rates , which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity .
Taking into account the considerable volume of short-term financial stre@@ ams , even a low nomin@@ al Tob@@ in tax would yield resp@@ ec@@ table sums of tax revenue .
In reality , the mo@@ tive underlying the increased interest in the Tob@@ in tax and other sources of international finance in the mid-@@ n@@ ine@@ ties was non-@@ economic . Indeed , it was fu@@ elled by the potential of this tax to generate income for international , public programmes at a time when demand for such funds was rising quickly and funding was increasingly harder to come by .
The Commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax , such as the Tob@@ in tax , as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation , so to speak .
Mr Dé@@ si@@ r too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides .
But if the Tob@@ in tax were to be applied unilater@@ ally in order to prevent attacks on a specific currency , then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market .
P@@ ut more strongly , in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds , the Tob@@ in tax will be ev@@ aded by shi@@ fting foreign exchange rate transactions to off-@@ shore tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
In that case , the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity .
So the Tob@@ in tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industri@@ alised countries which are prepared to participate .
Finally , even if the Tob@@ in tax is designed to cur@@ b spec@@ ulations with currencies , there is still the risk that even non-@@ spec@@ ulative stre@@ ams would be affected , and that is not the intention .
For the reasons set out above , I cannot see a good reason for introducing a European Tob@@ in tax .
At any rate , the Commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the European Union .
In more direct terms , to the extent that this measure could be deemed an indirect restriction on capital stre@@ ams , this would contra@@ ven@@ e the Treaty of Rome .
The correct spec@@ ulative approach , it seems to me , is to remove the real causes which lead to financial chaos , rather than attempting to sup@@ press its symptoms by introducing obstacles to the operation of the markets .
Madam President , Commissioner , I should like once again to say a few words on the modus oper@@ an@@ di and the ideological tac@@ tics behind this oral question .
Also because I know how many social democ@@ rats in this House share our criticism , and not just the economic and financial policy experts .
We know what the problem is : instability on the markets as the result of speculation .
But the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability , as the Commissioner has just so impres@@ sively told us , is the result of speculation .
The Tob@@ in tax would not have been able to prevent the crises in the E@@ EA in 1992 and 1993 or the crises in the south-@@ east Asian currencies in 1997 .
The initi@@ ators of this question do not propose a solution ; instead they are calling for a new burden , they are calling for more bureaucracy , for a measure which runs counter to the market mechanisms and they are taking up plenary &apos; s time with an inter@@ group opinion which exclu@@ des the competent parliamentary committee , contrary to several resolutions by Parliament .
In my view , and I say this quite clearly , the question is ide@@ ologically motivated rather than sol@@ u@@ tion-@@ focused .
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons .
Why do we reject the Tob@@ in tax and consider it so question@@ able ?
First , and the Commissioner has also confirmed this , because it places a heavy burden on the capital markets .
Even a small tax would have serious repercussions on the capital markets , because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profit@@ ability of investments considerably .
In addition , this sort of measure would also seriously h@@ amp@@ er the development of the financial markets and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital , which is one of the central ten@@ ets of the internal market .
Secondly , spec@@ ulative capital is extremely difficult to identify .
Thirdly , unless they are introduced in all countries at the same time , tax measures are easy to circum@@ vent because there are otherwise too many lo@@ op@@ holes .
Fourthly , technically speaking , this measure is highly im@@ practic@@ able and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control .
The measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today .
We need stronger banking supervision .
We need to clarify the liability for transactions .
We need a framework of regulations at international level .
We need to examine national laws in order to check that they comply with the rules of the Bas@@ le committee and how the dis@@ sem@@ ination of these rules can be step@@ ped up .
I have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands . I refer to point 9 .
Having listened to the Commissioner just now , we know that the Commission &apos; s knowledge of the facts will result in a &apos; no &apos; to the Tob@@ in tax .
If the knowledge of the facts and this debate and the arguments are as we say , and I think that they are right , then to take up another six months of the Commission &apos; s time and occasion uncertainty on the financial and capital markets would be irresponsible .
The capital markets do not want uncertainty from us , they want clarity ; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote .
Madam President , the debate on a tax on short-term financial actions is not a new one .
We have been discussing the Tob@@ in tax proposal for twenty years and yet the question is still topical because we need really concrete and honest answers based on careful studies .
We need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transactions really is .
This question has now entered a different dimension , a dimension in which USD 1 500 billion ro@@ am the world twenty-@@ four hours a day looking for attractive investments , no more than 3 % of which have anything to do with the real economy .
We are concerned about stability on the financial markets , not for the sake of the financial markets , but because this has to do with own growth , our own investments and our own jobs in the European Union .
We must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past .
We have done everything to help liber@@ alise financial transactions , but so far we have had no working set of rules , as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the Asian and Latin American crises .
It is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information .
It is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is .
We must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice .
At a time when the tax burden on the work factor is increasing throughout Europe and internationally , we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that includes the question of how to tax short-term financial transactions .
I think that we really do need a careful report and conclusions from the Commission , so that we as the European Parliament can see if we need to ensure that the European Union achiev@@ es real international solidarity with the USA and Japan in making the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure .
This is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forwar@@ d-@@ looking proposal .
I will have to repeat these arguments , mo@@ dest@@ ly , in this intervention , because the same issue has ar@@ isen once again .
We do not agree with this type of tax because its application , in the event that it could happen , would not achieve the aims which Mr Tob@@ in presented at the time and which the Left in this House wishes to revi@@ ve .
Firstly , there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of vol@@ atility and instability in the international markets .
On the contrary , since it is certain that not all countries would accept it , we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create vol@@ atility , instability , in@@ security , op@@ acity and unfair competition in the field of financial services operating on an international level .
Furthermore , the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically need@@ y countries presents such complexity , when we consider their application in practice , that it appears simply impossible .
This is a false debate whose aim is purely political , and has no basis or technical vi@@ ability .
Furthermore - since we are in this European Parliament - if we have still not managed the sligh@@ test agreement with regard to the package of fiscal measures proposed by the Commission within the European Union , how can we expect to achieve a fiscal agreement on an international level ?
I sup@@ pose that the first thing they say will be , &apos; let us see whether you are capable of reaching a fiscal agreement within the Union &apos; .
However , the Liberal Group has not wanted to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and , therefore , we have accepted a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carried out on the possibility and su@@ it@@ ability of imposing this tax on certain areas of international capital movements .
I am sure that this study - if carried out obj@@ ectively , with knowledge of the financial markets and their mechanisms on an international level - will show that it is neither suitable nor possible , not only in terms of its application , but also as a means of achieving the proposed objectives .
In itself , globalisation is positive .
The economy has never grown so much nor favoured so many countries on a global level .
This is due to progressive opening up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital .
Any analysis of economic development in recent years , if objective , will show , through the figures , that they have no political colour or orientation .
As I have said , we are not opposed to such a study .
We will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study , but we simply insist that , as this motion for a resolution points out , it is by means of liberalisation and opening up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress , both on the level of states and on a general level .
Madam President , Commissioner , the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature .
As Mrs Rand@@ zi@@ o-@@ Pla@@ th said , we must remember that the reason why certain Members want to revi@@ ve this question is because of the recent international financial crises and their economic , social and environmental consequences which have been felt by all in some countries .
The main objective of this debate is to look at the instruments available to the international community for stabili@@ sing the international financial and monetary system .
In this respect , Mr Bolkestein , the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the Tob@@ in tax .
If you look carefully , this proposed tax on capital is just one of several instruments aimed at forcing international investors to beh@@ ave respon@@ sibly on the financial markets .
Secondly , the motion does not say that we want a solely European initiative .
This is why we explicitly refer to the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund so that the European Union , in other words the Commission and also the Council , can decide how it will defend the opportunity to stabili@@ se the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation .
There should be no confusion in this debate . As environment@@ alists , we do not want an excuse for a motion .
Although a study produced by the Commission would doub@@ tless be interesting , we do not need another to add to those already available .
As for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty , very short-term capital movements are specifically intended to play on uncertainty and to bet on changes between currencies or various short-term financial assets .
This argument is therefore not relevant .
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments .
However , I would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion , but also paragraph 10 .
We clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund . We therefore demand , if this motion is adopted tomorrow , that the Commission and Council appear before Parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion .
Madam President , my Group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today , particularly as we have spar@@ ed no effort along with Members of other groups to bring this about .
Obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning .
Having said this , our Group is pleased about the step forward which the compromise motion represents .
This invites the Commission to present a report within six months .
The European Parliament can play its role by taking the initiative , even if it does so tim@@ idly , on this subject . However , I agree with the previous speaker that , if paragraph 9 were challeng@@ ed , this motion would clearly lose its substance .
This debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitim@@ ately raising . What are the respective places of people and finance in today &apos; s economy ?
USD 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world &apos; s currency markets . This represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services .
By putting finance at the hel@@ m , this has reinforced the demands of profit@@ ability and tou@@ gh@@ ened the operating conditions everywhere .
It has led to a growth in mer@@ gers , acqu@@ isi@@ tions and company restructuring and to gigan@@ tic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets .
Un@@ employment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing .
Open@@ ings and real growth are being ham@@ pered and the sudden influ@@ x or withdrawal of spec@@ ulative capital is threatening the economies of many countries , to the point of collapse , as in Asia , Russia and Brazil .
Fac@@ ed with this neo@@ liberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets , demand , as our motion recognises , is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipul@@ ates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly inter@@ dependent world .
No one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information .
In this respect , all ideas deserve to be considered , including the Tob@@ in tax which is important , just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged .
This tax could help to check speculation without pen@@ alising the activities of the real economy . It could release new resources for investment in people and , at a time when the UN@@ DP estimates the sum needed to eradic@@ ate poverty to be USD 40 billion per year , it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs .
When the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global , the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to rec@@ ap@@ ture the democratic areas sei@@ zed by the international financial operators .
The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industri@@ alised countries would be needed to achieve this .
I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industri@@ alised countries and , like Mr Dé@@ si@@ r and several other speakers , I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect .
In any case , the European Parliament would be hon@@ oured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone .
Madam President , I too am delighted that we are having this debate . I only regret that it has been so long in coming .
We know that each generation has , over the course of time , blin@@ dly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology . This is a set of prejudi@@ ces accepted as such due to a general con@@ form@@ ism , but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations .
Free trade and the constant wor@@ ship of globalisation are now the dominant ideology or , rather , the big mistake of our fin de si@@ è@@ cle . This ideology is as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the pro@@ let@@ ariat in the corrid@@ ors of the Krem@@ lin or , before that , the certainty , elev@@ ated to the status of a do@@ g@@ ma , that the earth was flat .
Our world is now dominated by a single logic or , I could say , a single go@@ d of money at work instead of people at work .
With a figure for trade in goods and services of FR@@ F 36 000 billion only being equal to the product of four days &apos; speculation , the financial bub@@ ble ow@@ es very little to the productive activity of individuals .
It is self-@@ perpet@@ u@@ ating in a world of ever higher bi@@ ds which constantly den@@ ies the humanity of man , the rich as much as the poor . Yet it is the latter who , at the end of the day , are excluded from the majority of the world &apos; s decision-making centres for these are mon@@ opoli@@ sed by a tiny minority referred to recently , and very ap@@ tly , by Jean-@@ Pierre Ch@@ ev@@ è@@ n@@ ement as the glob@@ alised é@@ li@@ tes .
It was natural that these é@@ li@@ tes would exclude any political concerns from their field of manoeu@@ vre , thus protecting themselves from any democratic control and basically managing to be both il@@ legitimate and irresponsible .
However , the people are fighting back , as demonstrated by their reaction during the incredible Seattle Summit . The leaders of the world , headed unfortunately by the European Commission , rus@@ hed forward sub@@ mis@@ sively , hoping that their do@@ ci@@ lity at the feet of the master of the world , Mr Clinton , would be enough to ensure them the sc@@ rap@@ s from the table .
Yet they reck@@ oned without the sal@@ ut@@ ary reaction of the no@@ bodies , both individuals and States . This reaction was more organised than previously , due in France particularly to the magnificent AT@@ T@@ AC network which is fighting with increasing support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transactions in particular .
The creation of this taxation , of either the Tob@@ in type or the more realistic type proposed by Professor Laur@@ é , could prove to be politically opport@@ une , at least due to its symboli@@ sm rather than its low rate . This is because it would basically mean that politics was reg@@ aining a foo@@ th@@ old in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are propor@@ tional to the degree of resign@@ ation of States .
Madam President , although some of the aims of the Tob@@ in tax are fairly worthy of support , introducing the tax exclusively within the territory of the European Union , as the first area of the world to do so , would sound the death kn@@ ell for the European currency markets .
If the world &apos; s other important currency trading areas were to be excluded from the Tob@@ in tax , the fact that tax was liable to be paid in Europe would lead to currency dealing moving to those areas .
This has already been made clear a number times in this debate .
It is not enough that all the world &apos; s industri@@ alised countries should be included in the scheme , as then currency trading would move to tax ha@@ v@@ ens outside that group of countries .
There should therefore be a universal application : it is not enough that the G@@ 7 countries or the other industri@@ alised countries are involved .
On the other hand , it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speaking , I do not believe we can achieve this - that the Tob@@ in tax dream might as well be bur@@ ied .
Furthermore , although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme , the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed .
The world &apos; s currency dealing centres will hardly agree to the tax revenue being used , for example , for a variety of well-@@ meaning , UN-@@ backed purposes throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remaining with them .
With regard to the Tob@@ in tax as a means of preventing future currency crises , it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being over@@ valued cannot be aver@@ ted through taxation .
For that reason , as Mr Kar@@ as also said , we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being over@@ valued in relation to its actual potential value .
This again would require measures to regulate the export@@ ation and import@@ ation of capital ; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way .
Although it seems a reasonable scheme , the Tob@@ in tax is not without its problems , even if there should be agreement as to its implementation , which I do not believe there will .
It has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information , and that the global economy will , in the future , rot@@ ate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital .
For that reason , the un@@ interrupted flow of assets in massive volumes between the world &apos; s financial centres is not merely spec@@ ulative activity , which has nothing to do with the real economy .
If this &apos; feedback &apos; mechanism , which gives users the opportunity to make choices , were ham@@ pered by measures such as the Tob@@ in tax , mist@@ aken decisions might be made that turned out to be so costly in terms of the economic consequences that the tax would never be able to make up for it .
Hence , as Mr Kar@@ as has stated to his credit , our Group is resol@@ utely opposed to the introduction of the Tob@@ in tax .
Madam President , I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on spec@@ ulative capital movements across currency borders .
It seems to me blin@@ d@@ ingly self-@@ evident that some action is necessary .
The size , un@@ pre@@ dict@@ ability and ir@@ ration@@ ality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies .
Computer@@ -@@ controlled selling programmes turned a random bli@@ p into an av@@ al@@ anche , bur@@ ying jobs , lives and industries across the globe .
The only arguments against it are : firstly , it would im@@ pair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little f@@ anci@@ ful in light of the financial feeding f@@ ren@@ zi@@ es we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world , in East Asia , Europe and Latin America .
Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the A@@ ids virus of the world economy .
What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency spec@@ ul@@ ators , stock@@ bro@@ kers and option tra@@ ders .
Of course , this cannot be done in one country ; it cannot be done within the single currency area , but it could be done at international level with global cooperation .
Europe , Japan and the US - the euro , the yen and the dollar , would constitute , in my opinion , such a block .
I am disappointed in the EP@@ P .
I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on .
Yes , I am in favour of such a tax , but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow .
What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to study the matter , to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax .
Equ@@ ally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax , but I cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue .
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind .
The tax has the support of 47 % of the people in the UK , according to a recent survey by War on Want .
In France it has had enormous res@@ on@@ ance , particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceed@@ s to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty .
This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament , the Council or the Commission .
There is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than : &quot; It has not been done before &quot; .
In the new millenni@@ um , with new global problems requiring new global solutions , they need to give good arguments why it cannot be done now , rather than why it has not been done in the past .
Madam President , Commissioner , a compromise resolution on the us@@ eful@@ ness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules . I have two or three points to make in this respect .
One of the main demands of the demonstr@@ ators in Seattle was , rightly , the establishment of this type of tax , and this is not by chance .
The proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich European countries pro@@ ving that they want to move away from the culture of eg@@ o@@ ism .
Everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtu@@ ous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its per@@ verse effects . The Members on the right should note this .
It symboli@@ ses the need for solidarity with the countries of the south , particularly those in Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific which ques@@ tioned us exten@@ sively on this subject in Seattle .
In order to fully achieve its objective , the money supply released by such a tax must be re@@ distributed among the poorest countries .
This is how we can give sense and mor@@ ality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south .
Madam President , we cannot just keep repe@@ ating the number which several previous speakers have quoted ; we must also mention the fact , Commissioner , that 80 % of these huge , daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days .
We cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lu@@ cr@@ ative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares .
We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action .
We cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-@@ economic activities increases more and more quickly .
It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doub@@ led from 7.@@ 6 % of overall economic income since Tob@@ in developed his idea .
We cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the spec@@ ulative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctu@@ ations .
Nor do I believe that this is im@@ practic@@ able .
Why should it not be possible for the G@@ 7 countries , the other EU Member States , China , Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tob@@ in tax ?
There must be an over@@ riding economic interest .
Why should it be im@@ practic@@ able , and it can be differenti@@ ated , to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions , all the so-called cash transactions , currency fut@@ ures and options ?
Why should it be im@@ practic@@ able to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardi@@ se the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and spec@@ ulative investments un@@ attractive .
Num@@ erous very difficult questions are bound to arise , but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St. Flori@@ an principle of shi@@ fting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold .
Madam President , we are not asking for more bureaucracy , as Mr Kar@@ as put it just a few minutes ago .
We are looking for solutions .
Of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea .
The Tob@@ in tax will bring some transparency to a very ob@@ sc@@ ure question .
&quot; The more progress is made towards trade liberalisation , the more rules are needed &quot; , as Commissioner Lamy said during the Millennium Round in Seattle .
He recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that character@@ ise the process of the European Union &apos;s construction is intim@@ ately linked to a huge amount of new regulations .
Now that financing is readily available across national boundaries without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary , all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day is employed in spec@@ ulative transactions .
We citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation .
To continue would be economic suicide .
Hon@@ ourable Members , Commissioner , it is often said that Europe has succeeded in stabili@@ sing the economic sector , but this is only true if we con@@ fine ourselves purely to the public sector .
If we look at the private sector , however , we will find not only that this f@@ abled &apos; financial stability &apos; has been un@@ successful but that we are most probably sitting on a volcan@@ o ready to erup@@ t at any moment .
The debt burdens of the private sector and the corresponding excessive inflation of Stock Exchange securities , the two main market stability indicators , have , for some time , been at danger levels , as the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe clearly illustr@@ ates .
The fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a pan@@ ic can be explained by over@@ ambitious expectations over future gains .
Sp@@ ec@@ ulative activities are growing beyond measure and are , in turn , generating profits which will eventually prove to be merely fic@@ ti@@ tious .
Over@@ -@@ optim@@ ism will give way to disappointment and fear , which , in turn , will result in a stock market and economic crisis .
The danger is too great for us to ignore .
We ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem .
Modern economic science has provided an exceptional instrument with the Tob@@ in proposal and others , which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start .
That is what we are lacking , Commissioner : the political will to make a start in tackling speculation .
No longer should there be a place in democracy for the wor@@ ship of , or for this fat@@ alist approach towards , market forces as adopted by the liber@@ als - and I am sorry that Mr Gas@@ ò@@ li@@ ba I B@@ öh@@ m has left - as this will only lead to its ru@@ in .
Madam President , Mr Bolkestein , the ignor@@ ance surrounding this debate is un@@ believ@@ able .
We needed a Greek Member to finally tell us what this Tob@@ in tax means .
You reject it flat@@ ly because you do not understand the first thing about it .
That the Right op@@ poses taxes is quite understandable , except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions , or rather billions , into Switzerland .
We all know that !
But now I call on you , in all consciousness , to help put a stop to spec@@ ulative financial transactions and undermining long-term projects with long-term capital .
It has never been done in south-@@ east Asia , it has never been done in Europe , and I can understand why Mr Kar@@ as from Austria has left the chamber , given Austria &apos; s financial record .
They are all tar@@ red with the same dirty brush !
We need a Tob@@ in tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene .
Madam President , I am totally app@@ alled by the Commission &apos; s , i.e. Mr Bolkestein &apos; s , political ignor@@ ance !
He should perhaps use his position on the Tob@@ in tax to ask himself why he is here at all !
Madam President , I too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre .
It is perhaps not by chance that the Conserv@@ ative ben@@ ches have emp@@ tied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades .
If we continue down this path , and this is the ideology , and declare the financial markets to be s@@ acro@@ sanc@@ t and even claim that any intervention in the work@@ ings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy , then we will quite certainly be on the wrong t@@ ack and that could take on quite dangerous propor@@ tions .
Those who own the monetary assets are currently am@@ ass@@ ing huge fortun@@ es which are again scre@@ aming out to be re@@ invested .
We have asset inflation of global propor@@ tions .
As a result , spec@@ ulative bub@@ bles continually arise on the financial markets , causing growing economic instability which , in turn , jeop@@ ardis@@ es the entire economy .
And it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result .
We can take action against this ; it is possible .
The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last , not only by the Commission , but by rep@@ utable economic institutes throughout Europe .
That too is feasible .
And then perhaps everyone will stop band@@ ying about arguments which are asking for trouble !
It is not correct that the Tob@@ in tax is technically im@@ practic@@ able - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer .
The fact that tax ha@@ v@@ ens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European banks here at home must not be ignored .
In short , we must not allow real capital and spec@@ ulative capital to become so remote from each other , because otherwise we shall be ste@@ ering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastro@@ phi@@ c results .
Madam President , let us indeed tax money speculation : it does not produce anything new .
The tax would be targeted at the right place : at the spec@@ ul@@ ators .
Who is going to defend these spec@@ ul@@ ators , when nur@@ ses and teachers are paying top rates of tax ?
Article 73 c of the Treaty establishing the European Union provides scope for taxation on transactions .
Those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax@@ -@@ recycling centres , the tax ha@@ v@@ ens , of which there are 62 in all .
The Union should make a tax pact , which any countries could initially be party to .
The low rate Tob@@ in tax would not cause tax@@ -@@ recycling problems .
It is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect .
The European Union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries , and you see how we are today .
The truth is the greatest problem is a political one : they do not want to tax capital , but raise personal taxation instead .
In the end tax would poli@@ tic@@ ise the global , un@@ democratic system of financial power .
Ladies and gentlemen , we must challenge the monopoly the world &apos; s spec@@ ulative elite have on planning the world &apos; s economy by remaining outside the tax system .
Madam President , may I begin by extending a hear@@ t@@ felt thanks to all speakers and , above all of course , Mr Dé@@ si@@ r , for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening .
Whatever one may think about the topic of debate , it is evident that it is an important one .
This is why it has been around for years , and it is satis@@ fying that the Commission is being affor@@ ded the opportunity this evening to give a response .
I would like to start by under@@ lining two remarks made by the Member of your Parliament , Mr Gas@@ ò@@ li@@ ba .
He said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon , and I share his view .
I believe that globalisation has helped many countries which , so far , have been on the si@@ del@@ ine of the world trade stre@@ ams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and , as far as I am aware , no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade .
In other words , as indeed already re@@ marked by Mr Gas@@ ò@@ li@@ ba , globalisation is , in my view , positive , and I am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years .
A second remark made by Mr Gas@@ ò@@ li@@ ba was that there is currently no evidence that the Tob@@ in tax will stabili@@ se the exchange rates .
I think that he is correct in this regard .
I too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabili@@ sation of exchange rates .
I am of the opinion that these are two important remarks , and that is why I am reiter@@ ating them here .
Madam President , could I furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the Tob@@ in tax on the one hand and the functioning of the European Union on the other ?
Sur@@ ely we are all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement .
Madam President , I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-@@ day work consists partly of attempting , in conjunction with my offices and colleagues , to completely integrate the financial markets within Europe , thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible .
In my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market , I am , in other words , opposed to all measures which h@@ amp@@ er international financial transactions .
You could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would , in fact , im@@ pe@@ de international economic movement .
Once again , the Tob@@ in tax is , in my view , at odds with the Treaty of Rome , and this is an important , theoretical obj@@ ection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening .
Madam President , apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations , there are also practical objections to the Tob@@ in tax , as already under@@ lined by Mr Kar@@ as and other speakers .
It has unfortunately been observed , I have to say , that the European Union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures .
This indicates how difficult these do@@ ssiers are .
If we have not been able to reach agreement internally , I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners .
I think that this will be problematic .
Madam President , Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabili@@ sing the financial markets .
I think , however , that instability is merely a symp@@ tom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes . I think that it is prefer@@ able to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when , as already stated , the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome .
In order to remove these causes , one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question .
Is it the case that these countries can bo@@ ast of what is ter@@ med in English &apos; good governance &apos; ?
Is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates ?
That the markets for production factors , including the labour market , operate flexi@@ bly ?
That is not always the case .
So if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability , then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first .
In addition - and this has also been mentioned already , for example by Mr Gas@@ ò@@ li@@ ba I B@@ öh@@ m , but also by others - there is a need for more supervision .
More supervision nation@@ ally - supervision by national governments of national banks - and internationally , for example by means of the IMF .
So I believe the best way to tackle the causes is by ensuring , on the one hand , that good governance is observed in the countries in question and that , on the other hand , there is more supervision nation@@ ally and internationally in order to avoid these lap@@ ses .
Madam President , according to various Members of your Parliament , more funding should still be made available for major projects .
For example , Mr Krei@@ ss@@ l-@@ Dör@@ fl@@ er spoke in English about &apos; long-term capital for long-term projects &apos; - this is an obvious issue .
My reply to this is that , firstly , countries should honour their ple@@ dges , namely make 0.@@ 7 % of their Gro@@ ss National Product available for development aid and cooperation , so that a great deal more money becomes available than at present for such long-term projects and via a route established for the purpose , namely contributions to development cooperation , and not via an artificial and probably harmful route , namely the Tob@@ in tax .
Madam President , I should like to leave it here .
As far as the resolution is concerned , of which I have seen a draft , the Commission will await the vote and will , based on this , determine its stance .
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate .
I have received four motions for a resolution , tabled pursuant to Rule 40 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
Madam President , unfortunately I do not have your master@@ y of the French language .
But I would be obliged if Mr Bolkestein would just listen for a minute , which I think he cannot do at the same time as talking to Mrs Rand@@ zi@@ o-@@ Pla@@ th .
Could you please draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him ?
Mon@@ si@@ eur Bolkestein , je v@@ eux vous di@@ re qu@@ el@@ que chose !
Unfortunately , my Dutch is not as good as yours .
But I would rather like to say something else to you .
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a Tob@@ in type tax just to anno@@ y the Commission .
We want to examine the possibility of introducing a Tob@@ in tax .
It will be just one of several instruments and hopefully you will be on our side in this .
From a political point of view , I always fre@@ t when people say , we neither need , want nor can we achieve these things !
It is not your job , it is our job to decide on that .
It also has something to do with the newly a@@ wo@@ ken self-@@ consciousness of this Parliament .
I just want to discuss it with you , no more and no less .
We can do so without going off at other t@@ ang@@ ents . I respect you as a serious Commissioner who wants to take his work seriously .
Please respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously , and that includes the Tob@@ in tax !
Madam President , an om@@ is@@ sion appears to have been made . In the list of tabled motions for a resolution which you have just read out , no mention is made of the compromise motion tabled jointly by the PSE , EL@@ DR , GUE / NGL and Greens / EFA Gro@@ ups and by Mrs Kun@@ tz and Mr Co@@ û@@ te@@ aux .
Mr Dé@@ si@@ r , I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution .
If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled , it will be included .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.
( The sitting was closed at 8.@@ 14 p.m. )
Ad@@ option of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Mr President , I simply wanted to pass on some news . There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid .
Some@@ one plan@@ ted a car bomb and one person has died .
On behalf of my Group , I once again condemn these terrorist acts .
Thank you , Mrs Fra@@ ga Est@@ é@@ vez .
We had heard about this regrettable incident .
Unfortunately , the terrorist mur@@ der@@ ers are once again pun@@ ishing Spanish society . I note your comments with particular ke@@ enness , as you may expect , given that I too am Spanish .
( The Minutes were approved )
Res@@ um@@ ption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament ad@@ jour@@ ned on Friday , 21 January 2000 .
Madam President , allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cer@@ m@@ is tragedy .
Two years ago , in Cav@@ al@@ ese in Italy , an American aer@@ op@@ lan@@ e from the Avi@@ ano NATO base cut through the c@@ ables of a cable car during a low-@@ flying exercise which exceeded safe limits , causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans .
Since then , the victims &apos; families , who have not had the con@@ sol@@ ation of justice , since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges , have been awaiting so@@ lic@@ it@@ ous financial compensation from the United States at the very least .
I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand sur@@ ety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities , and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims &apos; families .
Mrs Angel@@ illi , thank you . I have taken note of your comment .
Agenda
The next item is the order of business .
If you decide to add this debate to the agenda , it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Sei@@ x@@ as da Costa , President-in-Office of the Council , and Mr Rom@@ ano Prodi , President of the Commission .
Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President , I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents , and , since I publicly criticised the presidency in January , I would like to take this opportunity to say , both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group , that we now find the presidency &apos; s statements on this issue to be appropriate , and we agree on their basis , their importance and their form .
Madam President , it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure .
This debate is topical , exceptionally important and urgent .
We therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it .
( Applause )
Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal ?
Madam President , I shall speak against this proposal on the grounds of a principle which I consider absolutely vital with regard to observ@@ ance of the Treaties , and with particular regard to Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Madam President , until now we believed that the European Union was , according to the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Paris founding the European Communities , and subsequently the Union , an association of free , independent , sovereign states .
Even though many developments cast doubt on this , we did believe , in spite of everything , that this was the case and , more recently , reference was made , albeit half-@@ hear@@ tedly , to the principle of subsidiarity .
If you ratify ...
Mr G@@ oll@@ nisch , excuse me , you have one minute . I know that you always take particular care to ensure that the Rules of Procedure are observed .
Madam President , I thought I had three minutes .
Do for@@ give me .
If you ratify this development , then you are rati@@ fying the development of the Union into a body which viol@@ ates the sovereignty and the freedom of the Member States , and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a Union .
We have heard one speaker in favour and one against .
I shall now , therefore , put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote .
( Parliament gave its ass@@ ent )
This debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business .
TO@@ P@@ IC@@ AL AND UR@@ G@@ ENT D@@ EB@@ ATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
Tal@@ ks in Austria on forming a government
The next item is the debate on the talks in Austria on forming a government .
I shall immediately give the floor to Mr Sei@@ x@@ as da Costa , President-in-Office of the Council .
Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , the Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the European public .
Let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts .
Firstly , we wish to express our total support for , and our solidarity with , the statement of the Presi@@ den@@ c@@ y-@@ in-@@ Office of the Council and the 14 Member States , because we believe that this statement is in accordance with the common values , and not just the political force , which we have all built together .
In any event , these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party ir@@ on@@ ically known as the Austrian Freedom Party .
The Europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered , and the Socialist Group condem@@ ns the ins@@ ults which have been directed at the President of the French Republic and the Belgian Government , but also at the Socialists , who are European citizens as well , because , at the moment , the Austrian Socialists are being described as tra@@ it@@ ors to their country .
I will say one thing . For many years I was a tra@@ it@@ or to my country ; at least that was General Fran@@ co &apos; s view .
President Gu@@ terr@@ es was also a tra@@ it@@ or in Sal@@ az@@ ar &apos; s eyes , and that is something that I believe should also be stated and defended by the PPE-DE .
I also believe that the Commission , or President Prodi , has acted as a guar@@ dian of the Treaties .
However , I would remind him that , during his inau@@ g@@ ural debate , he described the Commission as a European government .
A government must have more ner@@ ve and more courage .
That is what I am asking President Prodi for at this moment .
( Applause )
With all due respect to a Commissioner as effective as Mr Fischler , and given that we have heard contradic@@ tory comments , depending on the translation , with regard to a possible request by President Prodi for the resign@@ ation of Mr Fischler , I would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this House .
Secondly , Madam President , we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people .
This is an appeal to the majority of Austri@@ ans who have not voted for Hai@@ der , who have voted for the clearly democratic options , committed to Europe , and I must point out that Mr Sch@@ üssel may have been Minister for Finance , but Chancellor V@@ ran@@ it@@ z@@ ky also contributed to Austria &apos; s integration process .
We should not be so politically parti@@ san .
The accession of Austria to the Community was a joint venture .
We all took part in it , not just one group .
Therefore , Madam President , I believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the Austri@@ ans to re@@ consider and reflect , because this type of men@@ ace , which we have suffered before in Europe , may not only harm Austria , but it may also spread , and I say this bearing history in mind .
Therefore , apart from the ap@@ ology which Mr Sch@@ üssel has made , offering us all kinds of guarantees , as did Cham@@ ber@@ la@@ in and Dal@@ adi@@ er in 19@@ 38 in Munich , I would like to know whether the PPE intends to implement measures in relation to the Austrian People &apos; s Party , if it goes ahead with this mad project .
Thirdly , if we do not stand up to this un@@ natural alliance , I can assure you that we can forget the European Union &apos; s main objective - enlargement - because , if we were Cz@@ ech@@ s , Sloven@@ es or Hung@@ arians , what would we say , faced with a neigh@@ bour who judges us on ra@@ cial grounds and does not want us to enter ?
I therefore think that this is a great day for European politics to comm@@ ence .
We support the Council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the Austrian people to seriously re@@ consider this completely cra@@ zy option .
( Applause from the PSE Group )
Madam President , my group welcomes this debate because it is a defining moment .
This is the first time in the history of the modern European project that we stand at the threshold of seeing the mainstre@@ aming of a party of the extreme right .
That is deeply distur@@ bing .
The FP@@ Ö cont@@ ends that if one reads their literature and their programme , there is much in it that one could share .
That may be , but let me place on the record today a long and difficult experience which we Liberal Democrats had with the Austrian FP@@ Ö in our Liberal International family .
As early as 1986 , we had cause to believe that Mr J@@ ör@@ g Hai@@ der was not a man whose principles or attitudes were consistent with dec@@ ency and modern liber@@ alism .
In November of 1991 , after a long internal debate in Liberal International and many visits to Vienna to discuss issues , we suspended the FP@@ Ö from membership and in July 1993 we exp@@ elled them .
We exp@@ elled them then and we continue to reject what Mr Hai@@ der stands for now .
Let me share what we learned in that long experience .
There were many in our ranks who said &quot; read the text &quot; .
There were many more in our ranks who said &quot; read the sub@@ text &quot; , &quot; look at the context &quot; .
Wor@@ ds in politics can be inc@@ endi@@ ary , can be infl@@ amm@@ atory , or can be conci@@ li@@ atory .
We found that Mr J@@ ör@@ g Hai@@ der , as a wor@@ d@@ s@@ mi@@ th , has been a voice for racism and for xenophobia .
He is a man who plays on fear and who has exploited vulnerability .
That is why this debate is important - to put down a mark@@ er that when you mainstre@@ am extremis@@ m , something profound is happening in Europe today .
( Applause )
I ha@@ sten to add that our quar@@ rel is not with the Austrian people .
We respect the rights of the Austrian people to their own democratic process .
We defend the rights and constitutional prer@@ og@@ atives of the Austrian people , but we here in the European Parliament have the duty to recall our fundamental values as set out in Article 6 of the Treaty - the values of freedom , democracy and respect for human rights .
Every right-@@ thinking person in this House believes that these are universal and indi@@ visible without regard to colour , class or cre@@ ed .
We must promote and defend those rights , all the while saying to the people of Austria : our quar@@ rel is not with you .
I wish to say with regard to the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency that we support the spirit and the political intention behind it .
It may not be an ideal initiative in terms of its structure but we accept Mr President-in-Office , that it is rooted in ide@@ alism and for that reason we are inc@@ lined to support it .
I share with President Prodi a preference for the Community method and we must look at Article 6 and Article 7 of the Treaty .
Article 7 talks about the possibility of suspension in the event of serious or persistent bre@@ aches of our fundamental values .
We must find a way as institutions to bench@@ mark and give meaning to this so that it has a reality and a substance .
Then we can work together by the Community method to root out this cancer within our midst .
I want to say Mad@@ ame President some words to Mr Sch@@ üssel .
Mr Sch@@ üssel is a man with an honourable record in European politics .
He now intends to ride into government on the back of a political tiger .
Mr Sch@@ üssel - you are assuming a very serious , personal , national and European responsibility .
That responsibility , which you Mr Sch@@ üssel now take on , is to respect the letter and the spirit of the European Treaties .
Finally , Mad@@ ame President , this is a debate which tou@@ ches on the heart of our democratic values and institutions and calls to mind that the price of liberty is et@@ ernal vigil@@ ance .
On this continent , of all places , with the experience of hat@@ eful racism that we have suffered from in the past and at such great cost , we have to insist that today &apos; s debate is not about interference with the sovereign rights of a State .
It is a do@@ g@@ ged insi@@ st@@ ence by the democratically elected part of the institutions of this Union that we will not as Europeans coun@@ ten@@ ance turning the clock back .
( Lou@@ d appl@@ ause )
Madam President , in my group &apos; s opinion , the European Union today faces a political and ethical challenge which is without precedent since the creation of the Union .
The European Union has certainly previously known situations where there were people in a Member State government whose ideas and actions were in contradiction to the guiding values of the Union .
However , with Hai@@ der and his men , we would see the extreme right , openly rac@@ ist , anti@@ -S@@ emi@@ tic and xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic , promoted to the rank of co-@@ rul@@ er of our Community .
Go@@ ing along with such a prospect would be t@@ ant@@ amount to t@@ esti@@ fying , albeit un@@ will@@ ingly , to the resp@@ ect@@ ability of a political force which is not resp@@ ec@@ table . It would mean making the unacceptable comm@@ on@@ place on the scale of Europe as a whole , it would mean making non@@ sense of the European institutions &apos; sol@@ em@@ n proc@@ lam@@ ations on the fundamental values which unite us and which we demand , rightly so , of applicants for membership .
This is why we support the spirit of the statement made by the presidency and the 14 Member States , as well as that of the President of the European Parliament , in@@ sofar as , unlike the lack@@ lu@@ str@@ e and ambiguous statement made by the Commission , it aims to make people get the measure of the danger and to provo@@ ke a response .
Of course , there can be no question of casting op@@ prob@@ ri@@ um upon the people of Austria .
Any action which can be taken must , in our opinion , serve the tw@@ o@@ fold function of pro@@ scri@@ bing Hai@@ der without , however , isol@@ ating Austrian society .
Democrats in this country now need our support more than ever .
The great joining of forces in protest in Vienna on 12 November last year must now under@@ go developments suited to the new situation .
We must have dialogue with them and join forces with them , stand at their side in order to offer the people of Austria some alternative prospects .
Finally , we must ask ourselves : how did we come to be in this position ?
Certainly , in the first instance , as far as Austrian political leaders are concerned , it is a matter of answer@@ ing this exist@@ ential question for the future of democracy , starting with those who have just taken the in@@ ordin@@ ate risk of giving the extreme right a boost .
But , beyond that , no one , including the European Union , can , in our opinion , be exemp@@ ted from asking themselves what grounds there are for per@@ mitting an uns@@ cru@@ pul@@ ous de@@ ma@@ go@@ gue to exploit the frustr@@ ations and fears generated by policies in which too many sectors of the population are dis@@ regarded .
This debate is now before us , but each and every one of us , male and female , is going to assume their responsibilities without delay .
( Applause )
Madam President , we could have been debating the need to reinforce the founding principles of the Union , so that we can uphold them together . Instead , we have been forced to debate the formal , substantial errors that have been made in the last few days .
We are aston@@ ished by the political na@@ i@@ v@@ ety of people who , with thou@@ ght@@ less words , have bol@@ stered Mr Hai@@ der &apos; s position in Austria and made the Union look ridicul@@ ous , riding rou@@ gh@@ sho@@ d over Article 7 of the Treaty by announc@@ ing un@@ constitutional measures .
We have never before seen such serious , cl@@ ums@@ y interference in the internal affairs of a Member State .
Of course , we cannot viol@@ ate the founding values of Europe , and in this regard , the Italian Prime Minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty : he mentioned the Treaty of Copenhagen , which I , like you , have never heard of because it does not exist .
Maybe he was referring to the Treaty of Amsterdam , Article 6 of which lists certain principles and Article 7 certain procedures , in order to establish that a Member State is seriously and continuously viol@@ ating the principles referred to in Article 6 .
However , up till now , Austria has committed no serious or persistent violation .
Apart from amoun@@ ting to interference , the statement by the Presidency is discriminatory because it author@@ ises the pen@@ alisation of a population and den@@ ies these people their right to choose who to vote for .
No political cohesion has so far come about , not even in the fight against organised crime , or in defence of the victims of genocide ; we do not have a currency that is even re@@ mot@@ ely stable or an economy which really does combat unemployment and poverty ; but it only took one minute of i@@ con@@ oc@@ las@@ tic fur@@ y to destroy the Union &apos; s credibility .
S@@ anc@@ tions can be imposed after the Treaties have been violated , but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government .
Otherwise , how will we deal with Communist countries which return to Commun@@ ism : will we throw them out of the Union too if Commun@@ ists enter into government , or will Stalin &apos; s grand@@ children be for@@ given for everything ?
( Applause from the right ) It is via diplomacy , persu@@ asion , knowledge , and solidarity , and not with threats or via anti-@@ constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles .
Bil@@ ater@@ al relations involve the States , so the 14 do not come into this .
This is riding rou@@ gh@@ sho@@ d over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking , with an in@@ competence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalit@@ arian regimes . It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions .
So many things set us apart from Mr Hai@@ der - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Al@@ to A@@ dige region . However , we already knew this .
However , today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union &apos; s democratic role .
We support leg@@ ality and democracy as expressed by the peoples , and favour uph@@ ol@@ ding national sovereignty as long as this does not viol@@ ate the principles of the Treaty or human rights .
We believe in Europe , while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union .
This is what has come of rus@@ hing head@@ long into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks .
We have built a Europe with an unstable market , not a Europe with principles , rights and politics .
And these are the consequences !
Therefore , we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restra@@ int and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people , thereby ensuring that this people re@@ tains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples .
Madam President , today we have an appointment with hypo@@ cris@@ y . Here we have a Council which has managed to fl@@ out the treaty and employ a method completely un@@ related to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a State in the event of a serious and persistent breach .
In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria .
There are risks , as we are all aware , but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach .
If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criteria to the European Union , then , most certainly , this European Union could not become a member , although the countries of Eastern Europe are required to meet them .
And if we were to speak of serious and persistent bre@@ aches , then perhaps we could mention some Member States , such as Italy and France , first and third , respectively , in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court .
We could mention , my Belgian friends , Belgium and the Dut@@ rou@@ x case , the doz@@ ens upon doz@@ ens of children kid@@ n@@ apped , tor@@ tured , rap@@ ed and murdered by leading person@@ alities in this country , where in@@ quiries are bo@@ g@@ ged down , making no head@@ way .
We could , if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested , require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter .
We could ask ourselves why the Austri@@ ans are rej@@ ecting 10 years , 13 years of party politics which has made one country - Austria - cor@@ rupt and rot@@ ten , just as it is now cor@@ rup@@ ting countries such as Italy , Belgium and other European Union Member States .
We might well wonder why 76 % of Belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56 % of French citizens have no confidence in their country &apos; s system of justice , and 53 % of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mad@@ ame President , my group , the ED@@ D , and especially my party , are very concerned by this debate .
We cannot , and we do not , support in any way the sen@@ tim@@ ents and politics of Herr Hai@@ der and we depl@@ ore his references to the Third Reich .
We also , however , depl@@ ore the fact that your Parliament should consider inter@@ fer@@ ing in the policies of an elected government of any country , especially one which is part of the European Union .
My party at home are certainly not ra@@ ci@@ sts , but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well .
Are you going to interfere with Great Britain &apos; s Parliament if we are elected ?
Mad@@ ame President , the people of Austria have spoken by elec@@ ting Herr Hai@@ der to their Parliament .
I believe they gave him 28 % of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government .
Your Parliament , may I suggest , Mad@@ ame President , should wait to see if the party of Hai@@ der has an effect on the policies of that country .
Then , and only then , might you consider if human rights are affected .
Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then , Mad@@ ame President and only then , may your Parliament consider inter@@ fer@@ ing in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union .
Madam President , as a representative of the Freedom Party , I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria .
My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the hei@@ gh@@ tened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights , having a sense of responsibility for one &apos; s own past , and the stability of democracy .
Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoul@@ ders for the often du@@ bi@@ ous image other countries tend to have of it , rightly or wron@@ g@@ ly .
The refusal of our government , down through the years , to acknowledge our complic@@ ity in the hor@@ rors of the Second World War , together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour , have done a great deal to bol@@ ster this negative image .
This FP@@ Ö has now entered into a coalition with the Ö@@ VP , due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999 , when the previous government was voted out of office .
This is the citizen of a state &apos; s prer@@ og@@ ative , for it is the founding principle of a democracy .
When the talks between the SP@@ Ö and Ö@@ VP broke down , the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FP@@ Ö for their support .
We were offered three minist@@ erial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being den@@ ounced as fasc@@ istic here !
When we suddenly refused this offer , an infl@@ amm@@ atory and rab@@ b@@ le-@@ ro@@ using propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehen@@ sion to this day .
The FP@@ Ö party is established in Austria &apos; s political landscape .
The head of the government of one of the nine provin@@ ces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provin@@ cial governments .
What many Austri@@ ans are wonder@@ ing today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fasc@@ istic cast of mind , and why the campaign did not begin until the Freedom Party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the SP@@ Ö ?
There is prejudi@@ ce at work here , which - without going into our programme - is reducing the dark@@ est hour of European history to a political spectac@@ le .
I am filled with dis@@ g@@ ust when certain of our opponents get mi@@ le@@ age out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas cham@@ bers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda , as , for example , the Italian MEP Ber@@ tin@@ otti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Hai@@ der of den@@ ying the hol@@ oc@@ aust .
Sh@@ ame on you Mr Ber@@ tin@@ otti !
You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda .
Den@@ o@@ unc@@ ing a democratically elected politi@@ cian as a Nazi does not make you an anti-@@ fasc@@ ist !
On the contrary , you are deri@@ ding the true victims of National Soci@@ alism and playing down what the fasc@@ ist dict@@ ators did .
Your behaviour st@@ ems from your own prejudi@@ ces , you are disp@@ ens@@ ing with any form of political debate and you are disp@@ laying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose .
The attacks against Austria &apos; s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a Member State are an ins@@ ult to the Austrian people .
That is why we are in@@ deb@@ ted to the Commission for taking a stance that separ@@ ates it from the rest .
The new coalition agreement is about reform@@ ing a democracy , the rights of the opposition , commitment to compens@@ ating those forced into hard labour ....
( The President cut the speaker off )
Madam President , to begin with , I would like to make one thing abund@@ antly clear : Austria is not in danger of experiencing a res@@ ur@@ gence of a one-@@ party system or of a totalit@@ arian system of right-@@ wing persu@@ asion .
Austria is a stable democracy ; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are affor@@ ded the protection of an independent judiciary .
Austria is a co@@ smopoli@@ tan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there .
There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Austria : there has been a chan@@ ge@@ over of power following democratic elections , in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found .
There will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition .
The Austrian People &apos; s Party , which I represent here in this Parliament , used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union , and likewise its basic political principles of deep@@ ening and enlargement .
We respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voic@@ ed in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria .
Our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present .
Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship , many people were perpet@@ r@@ ators too , although I refu@@ te any suggestion of collective gu@@ ilt .
The Ö@@ VP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union .
My country &apos; s place is not outside the European Union but in it ...
... , with all the rights and commitments that this entails !
Any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it prof@@ esses to in its mani@@ fes@@ to , and not according to the pre@@ jud@@ gements put about both by political ad@@ vers@@ aries and the international media .
A declared belief in human rights , democracy and the rule of law , in an honest re@@ app@@ ra@@ is@@ al of Austria &apos; s role in the past , in passing on information on the grav@@ est crime against humanity in the 20th century , the hol@@ oc@@ aust , will also be reflected in the fundamental acc@@ ord underlying a future coalition government between the Ö@@ VP and FP@@ Ö .
My party can be reli@@ ed upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of European politics and continues to be rooted in the European community of values !
( Applause )
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Repres@@ ent@@ atives of the Commission , it is a black day for Austria and for Europe .
Not even Mr Si@@ ch@@ rov@@ sky &apos; s web of lies or Mrs St@@ enz@@ el &apos; s words of appe@@ as@@ ement can do anything to change that .
For the day has da@@ w@@ ned : two irresponsible politicians , consum@@ ed with a lust for power , are selling Austria &apos; s image , political role , and to some extent even its economic interests , down the river !
( Applause , hec@@ kl@@ ing )
They are trading this in for a head of government &apos; s position and for membership of a government .
They are just as prepared to take on board the fact that Austria will go from being a rever@@ ed country to a revi@@ led one , as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens .
I believe - as do many who for years have campaign@@ ed against Hai@@ der and his brand of politics , and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community , in@@ sofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives , are grave and also inappropriate .
However , my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage , is directed exclusively against those who have prov@@ oked these reactions and continue to do so , Mess@@ rs Sch@@ üssel and Hai@@ der and their parties , ...
... and that includes their representatives in this Parliament .
Mr Poettering , it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as I am , albeit for different reasons , for you are having to defend something that goes against your convic@@ tions .
You are having to defend a certain Mr Sch@@ üssel , you are having to cons@@ ort with Sch@@ üssel as he is today and who , as I understand it , was recently told not to come to the representatives of the Christian Democratic party &apos; s summit meeting .
The argument that Mr Poettering himself used has come into play , i.e. that it would only be possible to depri@@ ve Hai@@ der of his my@@ sti@@ que if he were to be integrated into the political system .
However , in my view , he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this , into our political system , and into the Europe of today , than any other extreme right-@@ wing movement .
Anyone who feeds on prejudi@@ ce towards foreigners and ethnic minorities and gives su@@ c@@ co@@ ur to these prejudi@@ ces , whose programme features par@@ o@@ chi@@ alism and anti-@@ liber@@ alism , who displays lou@@ tish behaviour and arro@@ gan@@ ce in their international relations , and who has never yet distan@@ ced themselves clearly and unequi@@ voc@@ ally from National Soci@@ alism , has neither the intention nor inc@@ lin@@ ation to integrate !
( Applause )
This historic weight of gu@@ ilt falls on the shoul@@ ders of the Conserv@@ atives for having con@@ sor@@ ted with the w@@ olf of their own free will and waiting to be dev@@ oured .
That is how the w@@ olf - albeit on account of the self-@@ sacrifice of the Ö@@ VP - is sustained rather than kept in check .
I understand that Europe and the civili@@ sed world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government .
However , by the same to@@ ken , there is another Austria , the one where ump@@ teen thousand people demonstrated against the FP@@ Ö having any involvement in government , and who will continue to demonstrate against this government .
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria !
( Applause )
The more powerful this Europe becomes and the more vigil@@ ant it is towards authoritarian ten@@ dencies in the Europe of today , the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-@@ wing extremis@@ m .
For Europe is and will remain the most pot@@ ent guarantee we have against xenophobia and de@@ mag@@ og@@ y , or even against a rel@@ ap@@ se into barbar@@ ism .
Please support the Austrian people against this government !
( Applause )
Madam President , this is an historic moment , as it is now , at last , quite clear to us all that the European Union has gradually developed into a community of values .
We see this , now that the government of one Member State is being joined by a party which , as is known , does not respect all these values .
I would also like to say that the position of the four@@ teen states eman@@ ating from the Council was justified , as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union , meaning this is also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria &apos; s .
It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration .
As important is the fact that Austria &apos; s forces of democracy should be given support , as none of us wishes to isol@@ ate the country .
We know that most Austri@@ ans respect these values .
They have also shown how they feel : not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria .
Dou@@ b@@ tless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time .
I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy .
I also appeal to the Austrian President , that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces .
Madam President , I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group , Franc@@ is Wur@@ tz , reminded us of just now .
I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes J@@ ör@@ g Hai@@ der &apos; s party .
The fact that we are stres@@ sing this is all the more important because , as you know , we essentially disagree with the policies made by Europe , with its economic and social policies , its democratic deficit and the Member States &apos; involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans .
Our normal dis@@ agreement further emphasises our appreciation today : this is extraordinary because the danger of a res@@ ur@@ gence of an ir@@ rational , neo-@@ na@@ zi element in Europe is extraordinary .
This danger does not concern Austria , it concerns Europe .
We are talking about us , not Austria .
We know the social causes which contribute , along with unemployment and instability , to fu@@ elling ten@@ dencies towards this ; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia , racism - but with the inability and un@@ willingness of these extreme right-@@ wing groups to settle accounts with n@@ az@@ ism , we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explo@@ sive mixture being created in Europe .
Not only the Alpine region , but all our countries are involved : the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat .
The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation .
Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Au@@ schwi@@ tz ; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past .
Now , though , it should follow through with its actions , and the first to follow through should be the Commission , which , however , has been ob@@ sc@@ ure and weak on this , making the value of the presidency &apos; s position even more apparent .
This is the change we must impose on the Commission &apos; s action .
Madam President , despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples , which op@@ poses fasc@@ ism , n@@ az@@ ism or commun@@ ism , both new and old , and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the Austrian people , we are today witn@@ essing this sovereignty being denied by Parliament .
In the mani@@ fes@@ to of the Austrian Democratic Freedom Party , there is nothing to justify the accus@@ ations that it is att@@ acking the principles of freedom , democracy and respect for human rights , fundamental freedoms or the rule of law , enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaties .
I would , however , like to draw your attention to the fact that the President-in-Office , who has been so critical of Austria , has recently consi@@ gn@@ ed the inhabitants of Mac@@ ao to the sovereign rule of the People &apos; s Democratic Republic of China .
Perhaps , in order to strengthen the Union &apos; s democracy , it would now be appropriate to isol@@ ate Austria and crimin@@ alise a party that was democratically elected by the Austrian citizens , while bringing Turkey and its &quot; Gre@@ y Wol@@ ves &quot; into Europe .
Madam President , we are debating an extremely serious issue .
We are debating nothing less than the presence in a Member State &apos; s government of a political force whose doctr@@ ine and principles are in@@ compatible with the concep@@ tual and moral bases of the Union enshrined in its founding Treaties .
A simple reading of chapter 4 , article 1 of the Austrian Freedom Party &apos; s mani@@ fes@@ to is enough to make any democratic conscience sh@@ u@@ d@@ der .
The view that eth@@ ni@@ city is the defining factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group has sup@@ eri@@ ority over others , as is written here , revi@@ ves old gh@@ o@@ sts of the century which we have just left behind , which some hist@@ ori@@ ans have described as the century of hor@@ rors ; hor@@ rors which the unacceptable philosophy behind Mr Hai@@ der &apos; s mani@@ fes@@ to has stir@@ red up once again , to our amaz@@ ement .
Of course Austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-@@ interference in the internal affairs of a Member State .
However , that is not the problem .
The question is whether the Union can remain in@@ different to the formation of a government in a Member State which includes such a party .
Our answer to this crucial question is no .
( Applause )
Kon@@ rad A@@ den@@ auer once said - and he knew what he was saying - that the sur@@ est way to p@@ aci@@ fy a tiger was to allow it to dev@@ our you .
History is a comp@@ endi@@ um of events which could have been avoided .
Therefore , Madam President , the Union and the Assembly must send an unequi@@ vocal message , rej@@ ecting of the tiger of intoler@@ ance , xenophobia and totalit@@ ari@@ anism , so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of ab@@ dic@@ ations , ren@@ unci@@ ations and opport@@ un@@ ism which mark Europe &apos; s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price .
( Lou@@ d appl@@ ause )
Madam President , the European Union was built upon the idea &apos; never again &apos; , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia , concentration camps , anti@@ -S@@ emi@@ tism , hei@@ gh@@ tened nationalism or war .
The one and only significance of the European Union is the will to tran@@ sc@@ end the atro@@ cious history of the twen@@ tieth century which gave the coup de gr@@ â@@ ce to any ideal of human@@ ism within the heart of Europe , and which is still highly topical today .
It is not true to say that , when a government forms an alliance with neo-@@ Fas@@ ci@@ sts somewhere in Europe , this is merely a question of national sovereignty .
For this Union of ours is not a group@@ ing of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances .
It is a Community that is dest@@ ined to exist , in which , when the main thing is under threat , when values are under threat , all democ@@ rats must bend over back@@ wards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again .
Let us learn the lessons of the past .
In the thir@@ ties , when Ad@@ olf Hitler was democratically elected , although with a minority , many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and , Mr Poettering , in France , a number of men and women , on the right wing but perhaps of other political persu@@ a@@ sions too , thought , &apos; Better Hitler in France than the Front Pop@@ ul@@ aire . &apos;
They put their own pet@@ ty squ@@ ab@@ bles first , and the rest is history .
We must make a rapid , strong and united response .
I would have liked to hear your discussion with the Austrian President , Mr Poettering . We are well aware that he is very embar@@ rass@@ ed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance .
So our response must be rapid and strong .
Of course , the Treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intoler@@ able ; I was almost going to say &apos; irre@@ par@@ able &apos; .
History has taught us that Fas@@ ci@@ sts start to blow hot and cold : using heated words first , in populi@@ st , xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic speeches , and then cool words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ate them gradually , po@@ is@@ oning them , until the day they start to take action .
And when that day comes , it is too late .
So our Treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late , but we are not at that point : today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point .
We must therefore find a political solution .
I support the Council proposals in this , while depl@@ oring a certain lack of strength , a certain sp@@ in@@ eless@@ ness , on the part of the Commission which will , however , have to be vigil@@ ant on a da@@ y-@@ by-@@ day basis , with determination over time , since Fas@@ ci@@ sts count on the sp@@ in@@ eless@@ ness of democracy , they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end .
Our response must be rapid .
If today we do not staun@@ ch@@ ly support the Council , then history will judge us , saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the Munich Agreement .
Madam President , I am pleased about the fact that , in Austria , the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes , in my eyes , a huge victory for democracy .
Let there be no doubt about it : we decline with thanks a Europe which develops into a kind of &quot; big brother &quot; and which keeps watch over left-@@ wing political correc@@ tness in one Member State or another in a Stal@@ in@@ ist way and using Stal@@ in@@ ist methods .
European democracy and Austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a Belgian Government that embra@@ ces cor@@ rupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a cor@@ rupt party , which was condemned by the court , to the post of European Commissioner .
Today , we thank the Austrian people for this democratic tri@@ umph which is important to all nations within Europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech .
Madam President , this debate was opened by Mr Da Costa , who merely confirms that the EU presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States .
This debate , and the background to it , reinforced the point that the Council , the Commission and this Parliament itself are dominated by Socialists .
My delegation of 37 Conserv@@ ative and Uni@@ on@@ ist Members from the United Kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy , programme and tone of Austria &apos; s Freedom Party .
We share the widespread ou@@ trage at its attitude to history , in particular World War II , but also its policies on enlargement , on immigration , on race and its attitude to the European Union itself .
We were also ou@@ tra@@ ged , however , at the tolerance of the left for the ty@@ ran@@ ny , the terror and the exc@@ esses of the former US@@ S@@ R .
Even today , surely it is high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fr@@ at@@ ernal links with China &apos; s Communist Party .
Not a word was said by these same EU governments about coalition governments involving fel@@ low-@@ travelling commun@@ ists in French or Italian governments , or in German state governments , or even the British government &apos; s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in Northern Ireland today .
This , Madam President , is the hypo@@ cris@@ y of the left .
So we condemn that hypo@@ cris@@ y and the double standards , especially of the British government and the other largely socialist heads of EU governments and include that of the United States .
We should recognise , however , that the democratic process sometimes produces un@@ comfortable results .
This requires action to address the underlying causes , including an examination of the electoral process itself .
That should be our task , not political post@@ uring .
Madam President , Representative of the Council , Commissioner , a week ago , the big international Holoc@@ aust Conference ended in Stockholm .
Its aim was to combat the for@@ get@@ ful@@ ness and the evil in today &apos; s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-@@ n@@ az@@ ism .
It would be an ins@@ ult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite , at this time , into the institutions of the EU , a xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic party which fli@@ rts with Nazi ideas .
Secondly , I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evalu@@ ations .
We demand of the candidate States and of the countries with which the EU co@@ operates under the Lom@@ é Agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours .
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned .
That is why we are re@@ acting against this car@@ r@@ y-@@ on in Austria .
It is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened .
We are at a water@@ shed in the history of the European Union .
The Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values , something which we take seriously . Some@@ thing has happened .
The European Union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its sp@@ ine .
Madam President , as everyone has said , this is a very important day . It is the day of the first debate of European political life .
And this is not pure chance .
I feel that today &apos; s meeting is not a meeting of Europe , our institutions , with Austria or Mr Hai@@ der &apos; s party .
It is the meeting of Europe with itself , with its ra@@ ison d &apos; ê@@ tre , with the reasons why we are here in this Chamber .
This Chamber was not made for goods , it was not made for money .
This Chamber , and the European institutions , were build to uphold values , mor@@ ality and a certain spirit .
In the twen@@ tieth century , we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk , and mor@@ ality , values and the spirit which I mentioned can be mort@@ ally affected by viruses which have just one name : nation@@ alist gl@@ ori@@ fication , populi@@ sm and the concept of ra@@ cial sup@@ eri@@ ority .
The fact is that it is enough to read the mani@@ fes@@ to of Mr Hai@@ der &apos; s party , the FP@@ Ö , to find nation@@ alist gl@@ ori@@ fication , populi@@ sm and ra@@ cial sup@@ eri@@ ority in every chapter .
Re@@ ading only one sentence which my friend , Mr Vi@@ d@@ al-@@ Quad@@ ras , has previously mentioned , &quot; The nation is defined by its location , culture and race , locally , eth@@ ni@@ cally and cultur@@ ally . &quot;
Well , we cannot accept such statements .
If Europe has any meaning , and - my friends will par@@ don me telling them - if Christian democracy has any meaning , if the history of Christian democracy has any meaning , then it must declare itself radic@@ ally opposed to the statements made in this mani@@ fes@@ to and , whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same dish up again , must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation .

Madam President , we the Belgian Christian Democrats are concerned as , fortunately , are a great many other Members too .
The coalition which is being created in one of the Member States is clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly has a European dimension too .
Because what is it that un@@ ites us in Europe ? Sur@@ ely it is the values and principles of freedom , democracy and respect for human rights , more than anything .
The Austrian Freedom Party leader , Mr Hai@@ der , has repeatedly rep@@ u@@ di@@ ated these values .
He also rep@@ u@@ di@@ ates the basic forms of diplomatic poli@@ ten@@ ess .
He is a dangerous man .
The Christian Democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extre@@ me@@ -@@ right voters but never to negotiate with extre@@ me@@ -@@ right leaders .
Valu@@ es should take preced@@ ence over power .
We depl@@ ore , therefore , what is happening in Austria . In fact , we were sha@@ ken by it .
We are extremely disappointed . As a last resort , we would ask the Ö@@ VP to look into alternatives .
We keep remin@@ ding them about Article 6 of the Treaty .
We continue to fight against the tri@@ vi@@ alisation of the extreme right .
If , despite this , the coalition goes ahead , we would urge the Ö@@ VP party members to ensure that the principles and values which under@@ lie European integration are observed in political programmes , both in word and deed .
Madam President , Austria awaits a heavy responsibility .
Madam President , it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rej@@ ecting Mr Hai@@ der and his politics , but it is equally clear that opinion diff@@ ers as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics .
Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself ?
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation un@@ fol@@ ds from now if we set ourselves up to pass jud@@ gement on it here ?
Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days ?
From all accounts , this would only serve to strengthen Hai@@ der .
Who would want this to happen ?
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics ?
Europe is a community of law .
Democracy , respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold .
One of the prec@@ ep@@ ts of democracy is that we should not dis@@ approve of electoral out@@ comes but respect them , and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austri@@ ans , by virtue of their political culture , voted as they did .
It is for reasons of constitu@@ tionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did , and in a manner that goes against the Treaty .
It would be politically ast@@ ute not to isol@@ ate the Ö@@ VP but to support it as an unden@@ i@@ ably democratic , constitutional and well-known European party , so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community , and that is why we must give the Ö@@ VP our support in this difficult situation , and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take !

Madam President , they say , where I come from , &apos; it &apos; s three times for a Wel@@ sh@@ man &apos; , and three times , as I think you will discover in the course of that debate , I signi@@ fied my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent , and on several occasions , a moving debate .
First of all , could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday .
I must respond also to the fact , of course , that there were references during the debate - and I use some of the words employed - to the ambigu@@ ity , the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the fragi@@ lity of the Commission &apos; s opinion .
I am dut@@ y@@ - bound to say to this House , there is no ambigu@@ ity or fragi@@ lity or compl@@ ac@@ ency in the opinion offered , or indeed the action taken , by the Commission on this issue .
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement , as did the President this afternoon , to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by four@@ teen Member States in their statement on Monday .
Secondly , we said , in very specific terms , that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria .
Thirdly , we expressed , in very explicit terms , that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty ; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are uph@@ eld .
There is no compl@@ ac@@ ency , no fragi@@ lity and no ambigu@@ ity about any of that at all .
And , when I say that the Commission took that view , I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler , who is from Austria ; and who , once again , demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission , under o@@ ath , in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning .
Anyone , therefore , who invites Franz Fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is Austrian , should examine their own mo@@ tives in the context of a debate , which has been necessarily shad@@ owed by references to xenophobia and even more le@@ th@@ al evi@@ ls in this world .
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague , Franz Fischler .
Could I also say , Madam President , that the understanding of the presidency , the Portuguese presidency , for our position , was absolutely demonstrated in the clear@@ est terms by Mr Da Costa when he said , and I quote him , that &apos; Portugal and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community machine is not affected by the current situation &apos; .
That surely is in everyone &apos; s interests .
In order to ensure that the Treaty is uph@@ eld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine , we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday .
We will continue to do that , Madam President , without fear or favour .
That is our duty .
It is also a matter of conviction .
My final point is this . We understand the context of this essential debate .
There are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with Herr Hai@@ der &apos; s offensive statements , the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of altern@@ ating aggressive statements with ap@@ ologies , sometimes on succ@@ essive days .
We understand that , and we recall too the sometimes short and sel@@ ective memory that he has of Naz@@ ism .
And , when we recall that , like many others on all sides of this House , my and my colleagues &apos; inst@@ inc@@ ts are naturally ar@@ ous@@ ed .
However , the Commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of inst@@ inc@@ t .
And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning .
That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law .
Without fragi@@ lity , without compl@@ ac@@ ency , without ambigu@@ ity , but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people .
We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate , &apos; necessarily with acute vigil@@ ance &apos; .
I wonder , since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber , whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government .
Does the Commission support the Council ?
Thank you , Commissioner Kinnock .
I think that we have just had a great political debate , equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it .
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
Rec@@ our@@ se to the precautionary principle
The next item is the Commission statement on re@@ course to the precautionary principle .
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle , and it has been written together with David Byr@@ ne and Er@@ k@@ ki Liikanen .
The precautionary principle is not a new concept .
It has been used by the Community for some time now in a range of policy areas , environmental , human , animal and plant health ; and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the EC Treaty since Maastricht .
It also appears in a range of international texts , for example , the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio@@ -S@@ af@@ ety Protocol .
The essence of the precautionary principle is clear .
It involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear , but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action .
However , the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spot@@ light in recent years .
Events such as the BSE and diox@@ in crisis have stim@@ ulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary .
In view of this growing interest , the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle .
The basic aim of the communication is tw@@ o@@ fold .
To explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies , and intends to apply , the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reason@@ ed and coherent principles .
We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to disp@@ el fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a dis@@ gu@@ ised form of trade protectionism .
The Commission &apos; s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental , human , animal and plant health .
Of course , this objective cannot be used to justify ir@@ rational or arbitrary measures , but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear .
As such , while the precautionary principle does not involve the poli@@ tic@@ isation of science , as some have alleged , it does take us to the cross@@ roads between science and politics .
The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-@@ makers are prepared to accept for society .
It is therefore political by nature .
However , the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper .
Meas@@ ures taken must be propor@@ tional to the chosen level of protection - that is , we do not use the sle@@ d@@ geh@@ ammer to cra@@ ck a n@@ ut .
They must be non-@@ discriminatory in their application , that is measures should not differenti@@ ate on the basis of geographical origin .
And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken .
For example , if one product has been approved , similar products should also be approved .
Meas@@ ures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action ; that is , the measures should be cost-@@ effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment , that is the burden of proof .
All these elements have to apply cum@@ ul@@ atively .
It is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures , which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle . For example , a research programme , public information campaigns , recommendations and so on .
This communication does not pre@@ tend to be the final word on this issue ; however , it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use .
By setting out in some detail how the Commission applies , and intends to apply , the precautionary principle , we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level .
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you very much for your statement .
I have three short questions , the first being as follows .
We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice .
Does the document you have presented here today also acc@@ ord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry , Foreign Trade , Competition and the Internal Market ?
I am sure that your answer to this will be &quot; yes &quot; but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be ?
My next question , Mrs Wallström , is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation ; to legislation per@@ taining to chemicals or other sectors , for example ?
Lastly , will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation ?
In other words , will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached ?
. Thank you very much , D@@ ag@@ mar Roth@@ -B@@ ehr@@ endt , for these questions .
Of course , this is shared by the whole Commission .
This is a common communication which was written by the three of us , David Byr@@ ne , Er@@ k@@ ki Liikanen and myself , but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today .
It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an inter@@ service consultation in the whole of the Commission .
So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document .
Yes , I would say we already use this way of working with different , difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example .
And , I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle .
We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban ph@@ thal@@ ates in soft PVC toys ; and of course , we apply it in several different environmental areas .
It has been mainly used in the environmental field , but , of course also when it comes to human health .
So , we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it .
Mr President , Commissioner , regarding the relationship between science , on the one hand , and applying the precautionary principle on the other , the communication states that invo@@ king that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence .
Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , this acc@@ ords science a great deal of power .
We might ask ourselves , what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for ?
The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied , provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists . I would like to ask , what is , then , the definition of a recognised minority ?
How would you describe this ?
What establishes a recognised minority ?
If a political decision is involved , I would also like to ask : who takes this political decision ?
The Commission ?
The Council ?
And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this ?
What is the role of the scientific committees ?
What , also , will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up ?
Finally , will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent , public way ?
These are my three questions .
. Yes , Mr President , that is true .
There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear , but I will try to answer some questions .
Who will take the decision , who are the decision-@@ makers ?
Well , that depends on who the legislat@@ ors are .
This is part of risk management .
They have to look at , for example , the concerns of people in relation to a special issue , and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case .
However , it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle .
It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete .
That is , of course , where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science .
It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done , but there is no question of changing the scientific base .
We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision ; and that should also be done in the future .
You have to see this as a tool for risk management .
You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger , for example , or if you want to protect the environment ; and you have to look at the science that is available .
You have to assess all that and evaluate the science .
Then you decide to take a measure or not , to take action or not .
So , there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today .
Mr President , I have a question concerning an actual , concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle .
It is about bro@@ min@@ ated fl@@ ame retar@@ d@@ ants .
It is a fact that these substances are now being discovered . There are increased concentr@@ ations of them in both people and the environment .
There are many people who maintain that they ent@@ ail major risks , while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are .
Recently , both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban bro@@ min@@ ated fl@@ ame retar@@ d@@ ants .
I am wonder@@ ing , therefore , if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative .
.
( SV ) Mr President , thank you very much , Mr S@@ j@@ öst@@ edt , for this question .
The issue of bro@@ min@@ ated fl@@ ame retar@@ d@@ ants is an important one .
It was raised quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of ministers who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done .
We are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do .
Allow me to remind you , however , that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be syn@@ onymous with there being a total ban .
There may be a series of different measures which can be taken .
It ought not , therefore , to be immediately interpreted as a ban .
Where bro@@ min@@ ated fl@@ ame retar@@ d@@ ants are concerned , there may eventually be a ban , but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken .
This issue is extremely topical .
The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done .
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a dis@@ gu@@ ised trade barrier .
Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean ?
I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormon@@ e-@@ treated beef and genetically modified crops .
Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do ?
.
( SV ) Mr President , I am pleased to be able to tell you that , in Montreal , we have just signed a protocol concerning bi@@ o-@@ safety .
We succeeded there in agre@@ eing , at an international forum , as to the definition of the precautionary principle .
I consider it to be a break@@ through that we succeeded in concluding this protocol .
I believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle . We are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted .
It is , moreover , also accepted as an important and effective tool .
Mr President , I have two questions .
I shall try to be very brief indeed .
The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle .
As I have understood it , there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood .
Is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out , including a cost-@@ benefit analysis ?
In that case , I am rather concerned , because the idea was really that a cost-@@ benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced .
Instead , the precautionary principle should come first .
My second question concerns the burden of proof .
I remember Mar@@ got Wallström being introduced as Commissioner in the Committee .
At that time , she was talking about the desire for a re@@ vers@@ ed burden of proof . In other words , a product &apos; s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous .
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now .
. ( SV ) Thank you , Mrs Sch@@ ör@@ ling .
These are two important questions , and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them .
No , one must not begin by carrying out a cost-@@ benefit analysis . Instead , the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know , of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals .
When , on the other hand , the decision has been made to take a certain measure , the one chosen ought to be cost-@@ effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly un@@ reasonable given their degree of effectiveness .
It is not , therefore , the case that one must begin with a cost-@@ benefit analysis .
The second question concerns the re@@ vers@@ ed burden of proof .
It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases .
I have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this .
There , however , we are concerned with that particular area , whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern .
Therefore , the issues of the re@@ vers@@ ed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context . Instead , it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this .
It is , however , perfectly correct that , when it comes , for example , to chemicals , we must ensure that we obtain a re@@ vers@@ ed burden of proof .
Mr President , I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work , otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpre@@ tations possible .
I will give an example : a f@@ ung@@ ici@@ de has been proven to cause bab@@ ies to be born blind . It is therefore a ter@@ ato@@ genic substance .
Very well , it is a f@@ ung@@ ici@@ de , it k@@ ills off m@@ ould .
This ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity has been demonstrated by just one English laboratory , perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests .
Now , in my opinion , given that this is such a serious risk to health , the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market , which New Zealand has done , for example .
So I want to put this question to you . When human health is at stake , or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected , should we not perhaps carry out a cost-@@ benefit analysis ?
The cost of a baby being born blind is too high ; there are no benefits that can compensate for this .
In short , Commissioner , I would therefore like to know whether in this case , the precautionary principle as you understand it , would in any case , require the product to be taken off the market , until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary .
.
( SV ) Mr President , no one wants more than I do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radic@@ ally protecting people &apos; s health and the environment .
Obviously , I cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here , but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case .
The truth , of course , is that a great many Member States , and no doubt other nations too , have taken measures to protect their populations &apos; health which amount to using the precautionary principle , even if it has not always been called that .
Naturally , it is not in the first place a question of cost ; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided .
Nor must it be a case of sitting and calcul@@ ating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure .
I think , however , it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken , it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between .
In those circumstances , consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result .
I cannot for@@ bear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-@@ effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it , namely when I was on a visit to Africa .
At a hosp@@ ice for AIDS patients , I met two Irish Catholic n@@ uns who were car@@ ing for dying AIDS patients .
They were the first to say that , each day , they must think about doing what is most cost-@@ effective because resources had to suff@@ ice for their poor patients there .
We must be very careful about how we use resources .
I believe we can learn something from this .
We must , of course , always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broad@@ est possible help .
As is also explained in the present communication , it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-@@ benefit analysis .
Consi@@ der@@ ation should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge , and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people &apos; s health .
Mr President , it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions !
Commissioner , I would like to come back again to my first question , when I asked about the other Commissioners , for it may have sound@@ ed as though I was in j@@ est .
Indeed you responded in kind , as I knew you would do .
I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goo@@ d@@ will asked , that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union .
I have good reason for asking this .
As you rightly said , the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where , as yet , there is no scientific evidence .
How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time , for example by our partners in the USA , on account of the bi@@ o safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes ?
How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy , will not , as they did on the last few occasions with your predec@@ essors , keep pul@@ ling the car@@ pet from under@@ ne@@ ath you ?
That is exactly what it is all about , otherwise we might as well not bo@@ ther talking about the precautionary principle here , Commissioner !
Mr President , I think it is extremely important to point to the present communication &apos; s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of rep@@ u@@ di@@ ating asser@@ tions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protection@@ ist reasons .
I am certain that we are going to have more conflicts , for example with the United States .
We should not be so na@@ ï@@ ve as to think otherwise .
E@@ ver since we signed this protocol in Montreal , we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment , health and trade .
This constitutes a good example , therefore .
We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too , but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitr@@ arily .
We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle , and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it , something which is clearly established in the present communication .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed , so to speak , as more than an ordinary aspect of administration , even though , as we have been able to establish from the interventions , questions and rep@@ lies , it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance .
The debate is closed .
Intergovernmental Conference
The next item is the report ( A5-00@@ 18 / 2000 ) by Mr Dim@@ it@@ ra@@ kop@@ ou@@ los and Mr L@@ einen , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the conven@@ ing of the Intergovernmental Conference &#91; 14@@ 0@@ 94 / 1999 - C5-0@@ 3@@ 41 / 1999 - 1999 / 0@@ 8@@ 25 ( CNS ) &#93; .
Mr President , I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts .
Let me also once more thank my co-@@ rapporteur Mr L@@ einen for our excellent collaboration .
The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important , both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the im@@ min@@ ent enlargement .
The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twen@@ tieth century .
For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively , more democratically and with complete transparency , clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work .
The first and substan@@ tive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work .
From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit , it emerg@@ es that the agenda agreed there is uns@@ atis@@ factory and does not guarantee the essential and substan@@ tive changes required for creating a more functional Europe , one that is more effective , more democratic and more transparent .
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a frag@@ ment@@ ary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union &apos; s institutional bodies .
I will not repeat which ones , because everyone knows .
My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insi@@ st@@ ent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved , namely enlargement .
Gran@@ ted this , the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which , properly addressed , would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union &apos; s institutions .
Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which , for that very reason , are highly visible to the European public .
In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the conven@@ ing of the Intergovernmental Conference .
At the same time , however , I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform , I repeat , of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health , energy , culture , transport and even tourism .
Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be wi@@ dened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to ex@@ to@@ l the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency , which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end .
All the same , whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way dimin@@ ish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference .
This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union &apos; s Member States .
In light of what I have said , I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr L@@ einen and I have put before you , so that on 14 February , the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives , Mr Brok and Mr T@@ sat@@ sos , can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament &apos; s backing .
The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us .
Mr President , the Group of the European People &apos; s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki .
It seemed to us that the agenda lack@@ ed content , because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and , specifically , the protocol on the Union &apos; s institutions .
In Helsinki , the governments approved the idea that , as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States , a minimal reform would be sufficient . With more than 21 , a deeper reform would become necessary .
The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States .
It is therefore in@@ consistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contem@@ pl@@ ating a minimal reform .
We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union .
Having said this , Mr President , this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference .
In theory , we could have done so .
We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th .
However , we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place , precisely in order to facilitate enlargement .
Mr President , I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly .
The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament &apos; s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is wi@@ dened to include other essential issues .
Mr President , I would like to point out that this aspir@@ ation on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspir@@ ation to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself .
However , the European Parliament will be reinforced politically by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference .
This is for one very simple reason : according to the agreements made in Helsinki , this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues , which are currently decided unanimously , being decided by a qualified majority .
Therefore , the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase .
It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament .
Therefore , since the qualified majority will be extended , there will also be more codecision with Parliament .
However , this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supran@@ ational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union .
That it is what we are doing .
We believe that , in the political design of the Union , other issues need to be dealt with .
These include , amongst others , the incorpor@@ ation into the Treaty of security and defence issues , which have made much progress recently , but which must be incorporated into the Treaty .
Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights , and work began on its wording yesterday , which I believe has started very positively .
We are going to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see being European as an advantage and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the Union &apos; s institutions .
Therefore , Mr President , our proposals , which we will specify in another report , together with the proposals of the Commission , which has produced an excellent document - and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - are going to be used as conference documents .
We will talk about this on another day .
Today we must give the green light to this conference , and , for its part , the Group of the European People &apos; s Party , Mr President , is ready to give that green light .
Mr President , for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee .
We are giving a positive opinion on the conven@@ ing of the IGC precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be wi@@ dened .
The Amsterdam le@@ f@@ to@@ vers is not a very good term , because they are very important subjects in themselves .
Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC .
These first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were expl@@ ored in detail by our Member States during the last IGC .
They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study .
They need a political deal .
It is more a question of nine minutes , perhaps nine hours if it is difficult , locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects , not nine months .
In those circumstances it would be sil@@ ly not to wi@@ den the agenda .
There are other issues that should fruit@@ fully be looked at , especially before such a large wi@@ dening of the Union to so many new countries .
Nob@@ ody is asking for a Christmas tree .
Nob@@ ody is asking for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated .
However , there are six , seven , eight , nine perhaps , subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address .
There is time .
Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act .
It la@@ sted only five months .
The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty la@@ sted a year .
Only the Amsterdam Treaty la@@ sted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the British election if you were going to have any outcome from that IGC so that was a different reason .
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda .
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view .
The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles .
I thank the Commission for doing that even if , of course , I do not agree with everything the Commission said .
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward .
Nonetheless the Commission has provided a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who is here with us today for doing that .
They have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this IGC .
That is all to the good .
The Parliament , the Council presidency and the Commission are pul@@ ling in the same direction for a wider agenda .
I wish you every success , President of the Council , in making sure that the European Council agrees to this agenda and that on Val@@ ent@@ ine &apos; s Day when you start off the IGC it will be under good au@@ sp@@ ices and you will bring it to a good conclusion , also when the French Presidency takes over , by the end of this year .
We should no longer be worried that the agenda for the IGC will be restricted .
That is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to free@@ ze relations with a partner .
It makes it impossible for those same Member States , at the IGC , to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and adv@@ ancement of fundamental rights .
It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States , especially Britain and France , seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty .
It is vital that the IGC prepar@@ es the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the Treaty .
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court .
Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention .
Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shoul@@ dering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy .
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent .
Mr President , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance believes that the European Parliament &apos; s decision to r@@ ush head@@ long into giving its opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference under@@ mines the political significance of the request for talks with the Council , and in the end , makes it rather ir@@ relevant .
We would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion , and frank@@ ly , we did not appreciate the dis@@ cour@@ tes@@ y the Portuguese Presidency showed towards the European Parliament by schedul@@ ing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Val@@ ent@@ ine &apos; s day , the first day of the Strasbourg part-session .
Moreover , given that this opinion is quite important , we can still vote for it , and indeed , the majority of our group will be voting for it .
I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite dist@@ res@@ sing to see the lack of real interest in this reform .
The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States .
It is also dist@@ res@@ sing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that , in any case , the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act , and to prevent and recti@@ fy the course of events .
We must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference , and I firmly hope that this opinion , that was given reluc@@ t@@ antly , will not mean that the European Parliament ce@@ ases to exert pressure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference is not merely a technical exercise , but ro@@ uses the pas@@ sions that we saw a few hours ago in Parliament .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , to my mind , it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the Council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of dis@@ gra@@ ceful .
After all , we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance , that is to say , we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States , and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future .
How , though , is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now , i.e. before enlargement takes place ?
That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference .
We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future .
My group , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs .
You can therefore rest assured that the Con@@ federal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand .
What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe , and , in particular , a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being thei@@ rs , because they are instru@@ mental in shaping it and because the car@@ es and concerns , the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians .
The politics of closed doors and private discussions ; all that must be consi@@ gn@@ ed to the past once and for all .
That is why we need transparency .
I believe it falls to you , as President-in-Office of the Council , to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before , leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignor@@ ant as to the content of the treaties .
We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going , and its outcome , rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent .
We also take the view that the political decision-@@ makers must at long last change the hab@@ it of a life-@@ time and ask the citizens in refer@@ enda , once the Intergovernmental Conference is over , whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future .
In this way , Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy .
There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to .
As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights , I wish to make the following point clear : neither my group nor I are content with making a sol@@ em@@ n announcement about the Charter .
After all , what will the citizens say if we make a sol@@ em@@ n announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals ?
No , to my mind this would only serve to deep@@ en the credibility crisis facing the Union .
The poor turn@@ out at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone .
What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen ; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union .
Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens , and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year .
Of course , we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States .
We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform , as the Council has resolved to do , and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny .
We need bold change and , at the same time , we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small States .
This is something I would stress , particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States .
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will en@@ sue here in the European Parliament , on all the issues you have raised .
There is one final issue I would like to raise .
Parliament &apos; s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy .
It is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies , but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making processes .
What we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union &apos; s policies to date .
It is all about creating a socially just Europe .
A socially just Europe is still highly topical , for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union &apos; s policies .
Hence , to my mind , that includes having the courage to amend Article 4 of the EC Treaty , which defines the Union in traditional neo@@ liberal style as an open market economy with free competition . The same applies to Article 105 , in my view , for the European Central Bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the Treaty , of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment .
Mr President , the Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , as set by the Helsinki Council , i.e. foc@@ uss@@ ing strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged Europe , must be adher@@ ed to .
It must be adher@@ ed to in the interests of the fast , effective work of the conference , prior to enlargement .
This is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission , which both wish to wi@@ den this agenda far too much and , what is more , wi@@ den it in the wrong direction , i.e. moving towards centr@@ alisation and an ever ti@@ ghter European system .
Our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which , when taken together , form a real alternative resolution .
In them we say that the forthcoming IGC must look into a decision-making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty .
We depl@@ ore the fact that the Commission , in its opinion of 26 January , limits itself to following the routine path of a standardis@@ ed Europe enlar@@ ging towards the East , a centr@@ alised super@@ state operating on the basis of majority decisions .
The feder@@ alists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constra@@ int , but this is a totally super@@ ficial concept .
Quite the opposite , in an enlarged Europe , Mr President , the standardis@@ ation imposed by the impro@@ per use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing explo@@ ding .
Furthermore , the centr@@ alised European system , as we can see it developing today and as we can fores@@ ee it by extra@@ pol@@ ation , ero@@ des nations and , in ero@@ ding nations , ero@@ des the national patri@@ oti@@ sm which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves .
The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker , as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending .
This is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of Europe was clearly recognised , i.e. by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty .
We are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles , one which are still , unfortunately , outside the European Parliament and the Commission .
A flexible Europe , is a Europe which respects its national democracies , which rel@@ ies on the support of its nations , its national patri@@ oti@@ s@@ ms , instead of continually persec@@ uting them .
It is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats , not the constra@@ ining , con@@ vol@@ uted decision making procedures which the Commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference .
Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Ra@@ dic@@ als and I would like to say to the President of the Council that he has seen what Parliament &apos; s opinion is .
This is the message that Parliament is sending to the Council .
I hope that the Portuguese Presidency - and I add my compli@@ ments to those already offered - can convey Parliament &apos; s message and convey the result of our medi@@ ation work on Saint Val@@ ent@@ ine &apos; s day . In any case , tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda .
This message must be very clear ; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow .
We shall give an opinion - which is technically and legally necessary - on conven@@ ing the IGC on 14 February , but we shall give an un@@ favourable opinion of its content .
There is clearly a more ambitious goal .
We Ra@@ dic@@ als have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the House in order to consolidate this text , and for example , to request - just for the sake of mentioning Articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be done , i.e. , that the European Parliament should also be involved in drawing up the European Constitution and that a proposal be made for the European Parliament to adopt the amendments to the Treaty .
We know that there are other topics : for example , many Members have subscri@@ bed , along with us , to the issue of the seat of the institutions , an issue that we believe should be considered at least at IGC level .
In conclusion , I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once , so that thanks also to the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency , this agenda will be revised . Otherwise , the challenge really would be lost , not just for the present but also for many years to come .
Mr President , the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference .
And , in this regard , you are going to the heart of democracy as it relates to distribution policy and people &apos; s social conditions , which are what voters wish to influence when they go to the poll@@ s .
These are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day .
Brussels knows best .
Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency , but his draft regulation signals a clear back@@ ward step , and that is not only my assessment , but also that of the European Ombudsman .
Today , the Commission is obliged , on a cas@@ e-@@ by-@@ case basis , to wei@@ gh considerations of confidentiality against people &apos; s demands for , and exp@@ ec@@ tation of , transparency and , if the Commission &apos; s regulation is adopted , the Commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration .
There is also the desire to create a legal enti@@ t@@ lement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of Member States .
Under the b@@ anner of &quot; progress towards transparency &quot; , a range of documents is being locked away from the general public .
It is , of course , thoroughly Or@@ wel@@ lian .
I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not , at the same time , available for critical scrutiny by the public .
Mr Prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism , for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the Commission &apos; s possession . There follows , however , a long , long list of exceptions , and there is legal enti@@ t@@ lement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions .
The French text contains the word &quot; refuse &quot; and the English text the word &quot; shall &quot; , which means that the Commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public , for example in my own country .
In addition , we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions , which may be used for any purposes whatsoever . It is therefore ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Portuguese Council Presidency &apos; s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well-@@ considered ideas and a high degree of openness .
We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve .
The preparations the Commission has made so far are on the right track , although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament &apos; s motions are anything to go by .
There is more to be said on that score .
It is cru@@ cially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat tri@@ ck ; that of the power to act , democratic legitimacy and transparency .
In the end , it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens .
At the same time of course , we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union .
If we have been having a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is .
The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government elec@@ ting to impose a total block@@ ade .
This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-@@ requ@@ isite to the European Union &apos; s being able to function come what may .
This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned , and legislation and in relation to treaties , which ent@@ ail changes being made to legislation .
Of course we also want to extend the European Parliament &apos; s corresponding powers in this area .
In addition , we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union , for there is a lack of supervision in this area .
The Finance Ministers beh@@ ave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting , when in the Eco@@ fin Council and in the Euro 11 Council , which is an unacceptable way to go on .
Unlike Mrs Kauf@@ mann , I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank .
However , there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side .
Furthermore , the tri@@ parti@@ te relationship of Commission , Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy , where hi@@ therto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case , especially in relation to the cru@@ d@@ ely fashi@@ oned crisis management measures , for which the Commission alone has responsibility .
The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this .
We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference .
The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliber@@ ations on this matter , perhaps to extend the mandate .
There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to .
The debates we are having these days , on a certain European country &apos; s government , for example , show , do they not , that we must place the spiritual , moral , constitutional , community and common wel@@ f@@ are@@ -@@ orient@@ ated le@@ an@@ ings of the European Union on a firm footing , and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason , as this will be a crucial stabili@@ sing factor .
I would urge those who are still very hes@@ it@@ ant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps plu@@ ck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights .
The European Union needs few , if any , new instruments , and it does not need any new competences .
What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice .
For this reason , we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out , on behalf of the citizens , the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty .
In my view , that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on .
If we succeed in making progress here , then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlar@@ ging the European Union .
This is the cru@@ x of the matter .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I am confident that this will be tackled in a su@@ itably positive manner under your tut@@ el@@ age .
, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs . ( IT ) Mr President-in-Office , on listening to the various interventions , you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament &apos; s political groups , the decision prev@@ ailed - although not without some dis@@ agreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency , instead of creating more difficulties by postp@@ oning the start of the Intergovernmental Conference .
I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this , last week in the Committee I chair , but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this w@@ ager .
You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries , and therefore in their parliaments .
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments , which were represented by competent and exac@@ ting delegations .
The aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging .
We need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the Union &apos; s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference table .
However , we shall intensi@@ fy our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference .
Yesterday , we also discussed the Commission , represented by Commissioner Barnier , who gave its opinion . This effort was appreciated , even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals , and moreover , Mr President-in-Office , you also expressed different views .
Nevertheless , we must stress that many people are aware , as they were yesterday too , of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political Europe , a risk that was , moreover , indicated in an interview that surely escap@@ ed no one &apos; s attention , owing to the authority of the person being inter@@ viewed - Jacques Del@@ ors .
We must , therefore , ensure that at the Intergovernmental Conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic bases of the Union and how to strengthen - and this has been discussed in the House even today , with regard to the situation in Austria - the system of principles , values and rights under@@ p@@ inning the Union and the role of the political institutions of the Union , with regard , among other things , to running the economy .
We are counting on the Portuguese Presidency , we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the Commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference .
Mr President , only a strengthened Europe can cope with enlargement .
Only a strengthened Europe is immune to political opport@@ un@@ ists who exploit dis@@ satisfaction .
That is why swe@@ eping reforms are necessary and , hence , a wi@@ dened IGC agenda .
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minim@@ alist governments and , unfortunately , turned a de@@ af ear to this Parliament .
Portugal should not take a lea@@ f out its predecessor &apos; s book .
It is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament and the Commission join forces for this IGC .
In many ways , they share the same interests and the same insi@@ ghts .
An essential component of this joint effort should , in any case , be this Parliament &apos; s right of ass@@ ent to the forthcoming changes to the Treaty .
Of all priorities , this one is the most pressing .
What is the Commission &apos; s ver@@ dict on this ?
It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and , therefore , not only within the working party , but also at the same political level as the Commission .
There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission .
Not only do we owe the swe@@ eping reforms to the new Member States , but we owe them to ourselves .
If we allow Europe to be water@@ ed down as a result of enlargement , we will dro@@ wn in our own political qu@@ ag@@ mire .
Mr President , there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament . It seems to take a mas@@ och@@ istic pleasure in self-@@ mu@@ til@@ ation .
Why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow , 3 February , as a matter of urgency , when we could wait , in a position of strength , until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February , and thus force an agenda that is complete , and therefore consistent , on the Council .
A good dose of hypo@@ cris@@ y is needed to over@@ look our weakness today . Hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y to be reg@@ ret@@ ted bit@@ terly , in our resolution , that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues , since in our ha@@ ste , with bl@@ ame@@ worthy na@@ i@@ v@@ ety , we are st@@ opping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda .
If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC , then I say that the political groups which so wanted this ha@@ ste will be accountable for this .
Whether we want it or not , since Parliament itself is going to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the only spot@@ light capable of sh@@ ed@@ ding a little light on the debates , the venue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union .
I therefore invite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority , those who last November ruled that the future of Europe was deser@@ ving of debates that went far wider than the Amsterdam le@@ f@@ to@@ vers , to take up their pilgri@@ ms &apos; sta@@ ffs and go and convince their own governments that this IGC must be extended , since this is permitted according to the resolution of the Helsinki Council .
Because of the situation in Austria , this is a dark day for Europe .
It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive , and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing .
In order to asser@@ t our fundamental values , they need to be laid down in writing , as a matter of urgency , and , beyond this IGC , I believe we owe Europe a constitution .
Mr President , the draft resolution we are now discussing requires , precisely as before , that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions .
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this .
I am convinced that this is an error of jud@@ gement .
A federal and centr@@ alist EU which interven@@ es more and more in the government of the Member States is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement .
A flexible EU which concentr@@ ates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embra@@ cing a significantly greater number of countries .
Paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level .
It is not , however , possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union .
This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank . This is un@@ ten@@ able .
If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic , the whole construction of EMU must be re@@ considered .
The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity .
Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible .
The rigid and un@@ successful mon@@ et@@ ar@@ ism of the Stability Pact must be re-@@ examined and dis@@ car@@ ded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective .
Article 56 of the Treaty , prohi@@ bit@@ ing currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital , must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control .
In the majority of EU countries , there are now governments dominated by social democ@@ rats .
It is remarkable that , now they have the opportunity to do so , none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union .
It also , of course , damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counter@@ balance to glob@@ alised capital .
The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference .
It is , however , important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States .
It is the Member States &apos; parliaments , or people voting in refer@@ enda , who are to direct the development of the Treaty .
It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification .
Mr President , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text , which I shall vote for , even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to bro@@ aden it .
Nevertheless , the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right .
The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values , whether it comes down to an economic free trade area , or whether , on the other hand , it has a greater ambition : the desire to be a supran@@ ational union , in ways that have yet to be defined , that wants to bla@@ ze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world .
This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution .
The amendment of the Treaties was , however , limited to a review of some internal rules , which was necessary and important , but did not answer the fundamental question : what is Europe , what are its common principles and therefore , its objectives and limitations ?
However , politics ex@@ acts its re@@ ven@@ ge , and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda , it comes back in , as a matter of fact , through a door , and through the front door in the case of Austria , since a party is entering the Austrian Government which seems to represent a return to intoler@@ ance , xenophobia and forms of racism .
And it is not a question of links with the past ; it is a question of prospects for the future , and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this .
I belong to a world , the world of Liberal Catho@@ lic@@ s , which is not left-@@ wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common European values , and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values .
The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights , in a European Constitution , then we shall construct a Europe without a solid , lasting base .
Commissioner Barnier , I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values : make the most of the chances you were given by the December Conference to include these subjects and principles , because this is the only way we will build a lasting Europe .
Mr President , I am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of Nordic scep@@ tics and opponents of the dr@@ astic and growing integration process which , looked long and hard at , threatens the whole of democratic Europe .
I am thinking of the contributions from Mr Bon@@ de and Mr S@@ j@@ öst@@ edt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively un@@ conscious but undoubtedly rational initiatives dict@@ ated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centr@@ alist and feder@@ alist EU .
They rightly included the problem with monetary union and centr@@ alist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles .
However , that is precisely what is happening .
With every single geographical extension to the area covered by the EU , we have seen how exten@@ sions in b@@ read@@ th have been followed by intensive exten@@ sions in depth , and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the Committee is contem@@ pl@@ ating , especially in paragraph 7 which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth .
In the light of developments in recent days , it might well be asked what we really are to do about these intergovernmental conferences and treaty amendments when government leaders - in reality the European Council of Ministers - make decisions in relation to an independent Member State ent@@ ailing intervention in that Member State &apos; s democratic process .
You can think what you like about Mr Hai@@ der , and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politi@@ cian , but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country &apos; s democratic process .
When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty , we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time , sometimes in contra@@ vention of the Treaty , as we have just seen .
I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon .
On 14 February , we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000 .
This is a big task but it can be done .
I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement .
In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important &quot; Amsterdam le@@ f@@ to@@ vers &quot; .
These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-@@ weigh@@ ting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe .
In relation to the latter point , Ireland wants to maintain the right to nomin@@ ate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining .
We are prepared to consider re-@@ weigh@@ ting the votes in the Council of Ministers , provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission .
I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point .
At the IGC , we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution .
We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-@@ negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty .
In other words , if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions .
So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully .
We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents .
The Treaty of Amsterdam , Mr President , has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe .
Mr President , I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dim@@ it@@ ra@@ kop@@ ou@@ los / L@@ einen resolution , which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the in@@ adequ@@ acy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible .
In any case , this emerg@@ es from the favourable schedule we decided upon .
I think that , under the present rules of the Treaties , the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confron@@ tation .
On the contrary , we should concentrate on working out persu@@ asi@@ ve proposals on the necessary reforms , in collaboration with the Commission whose own proposals are worthy of note .
We must use dialogue at every political level , including of course dialogue with the national parliaments .
That way , we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms .
Parliament &apos; s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that , with the Union &apos; s institutional changes , we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union .
They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the r@@ ationale of bar@@ gaining alone .
The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive .
It may be easy to come up with solutions , but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term .
I will mention two point that may create tension .
One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries .
Europe is not , nor can it become a classic federal state .
The solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental r@@ ationale of the European Union , which is a union of states and peoples .
The other area of conflict is more difficult .
O@@ wing to the im@@ min@@ ent increase in membership , the bodies of the future European Union must become more effective .
This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly .
By its very nature , however , the European Union is , and will remain , a complex and con@@ vol@@ uted multi-@@ governmental institution .
Po@@ ssi@@ bili@@ ties for faster and more simple operation do exist . Of course they do , but they are not unlimited .
If the limits are exceeded because of a one-@@ si@@ ded quest for effectiveness , then the legitim@@ ising basis of the European Union will suffer .
I am , however , optimistic .
Mr President , the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be wi@@ dened .
The most important issue with regard to this is internal differenti@@ ation within the Union .
It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differenti@@ ation within the Union , which will , however , be necessary if the Union is to en@@ large as planned .
The Commission &apos; s former president , Jacques Del@@ ors , has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Con@@ federation . He has also said that the countries in the van@@ guard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions , for the sake of clarity .
The Commission &apos; s current President , Mr Prodi , and the High Representative , Mr Solana , have put forward ideas along the same lines .
Last November , the Group of the European Liberal Democ@@ rat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differenti@@ ation within the Union when it proposed a system of conc@@ entri@@ c rings for Europe : the on@@ ion skin model .
In the next resolution on the IGC , Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differenti@@ ation and flexibility .
Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of conc@@ entri@@ c rings , as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party .
My colleagues , Mrs Fr@@ ass@@ oni and Mr On@@ esta have already spoken , somewhat scep@@ tically , about some aspects of the matter in hand .
I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity , not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-@@ governing regions .
This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about .
May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament .
A ceiling of 700 has been prescri@@ bed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliber@@ ative assembly .
If you apply the existing principle of dig@@ res@@ sive propor@@ tionality , six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants , you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 36@@ 7@@ ,000 people has more Members in this Chamber than Wales , which is a partly self-@@ governing region of the United Kingdom .
Scotland , with a population of 5 million , has eight seats in this House at the moment ; Denmark and Finland , with the same population , have six@@ teen .
Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700 , bring in 26 % more population over time , and then adopt the Commission &apos; s , I think ill-@@ considered , pro@@ position , that there should be a European list of candidates .
What will happen to a place like Scotland , which I represent here ?
It will become totally in@@ visible !
Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions , people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of ad@@ mitting new Member States from within existing ones .
A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view .
Mr President , to say that the European Union is at a cross@@ roads is no doubt nothing new .
It has been said many times .
This time , however , it is true . We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement .
The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not .
Will we en@@ large with or without deep reform ?
That is the debate , and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference , its agenda or its method .
It is clear that the Council , for the moment , has not op@@ ted for enlar@@ ging with deep reforms in place .
That puts enlargement in danger .
It jeop@@ ardis@@ es any prospect of political union and , of course , it is difficult for the public to understand .
The Council must realise that , if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations , the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further .
The Council is consulting us and Parliament is giving its opinion .
We want an Intergovernmental Conference , but not this one .
M@@ ust there be an IGC ?
Of course there must , but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference .
The agenda must go much further .
We must be much more dar@@ ing with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic .
Being much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes , more - its ability to take the initiative .
We must clearly set firm objectives .
The func@@ tion@@ alist approach is over , for better or for worse .
The func@@ tion@@ alist approach has brought us to this point .
Have we achieved results ?
Yes , but the point is to make a qualitative le@@ ap and , speaking in political terms , this , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen of the House , at this stage , following this debate which I have listened to most atten@@ tively and with great interest , I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and me@@ ticul@@ ous work , your two rapporteurs , Mr Dim@@ it@@ ra@@ kop@@ ou@@ los and Mr L@@ einen , proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus , if this opinion were adopted , the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February , as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency .
As far as we are concerned , after producing the opinion expected from the Commission , according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty , we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated .
We know , I know myself , that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us .
I would just like to make a few comments , after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups .
Firstly , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission understands the anx@@ i@@ ety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda .
I understand this anx@@ i@@ ety , this fear that the agenda may be too limited , and yet I feel , as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki , that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate .
Indeed , it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate , which the Commission fr@@ amed for its own opinion , but using all the terms thereof , plus everything between the lines .
We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called le@@ f@@ to@@ vers , which is , in any case , an incorrect label .
I do not like the term &apos; le@@ f@@ to@@ vers &apos; any more than Richard Corbett does .
It gives the impression that they are three minor or in@@ significant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects , and difficult , so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage coll@@ ectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth .
As far as we are concerned - I am responding to Mr Seg@@ ur@@ o who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects , even though I do consider them as priorities , and consider that they must be dealt with now .
They are the first but they are not the only subjects , Mr Seg@@ ur@@ o , that the conference must deal with .
We have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference , if the Portuguese Presidency firstly , and then the French Presidency , so wish , in view of the serious nature of the present junc@@ ture prior to enlargement .
We are ready for it , whether it is a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , on which work has started , the CF@@ SP and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations , or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work : re@@ organisation of the Treaties .
I have heard many comments on the Commission &apos; s opinion , which mentioned all these subjects and dealt with many of them in depth , with specific indications of new draft articles , but no one has said that we were going beyond the Helsinki mandate .
This proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate , by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the open@@ ings which it offers .
As regards the participation of the European Parliament in the conference proceedings , I think that Mr Sei@@ x@@ as da Costa will agree with me , on the basis of our shared experience , in saying that you would be wrong to dis@@ regard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives , Professor T@@ sat@@ sos and Mr Brok , are going to be working .
Of course , the final tra@@ de-@@ off@@ s will be made , as in any institutional negotiations , and I think this is no bad thing , at Council level , especially at the level of the Council of Heads of State and Government , who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands .
Let me point out , in passing , that the Commission President , Mr Prodi , is also a Council member , and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role , alongside the Heads of State and Government , particularly during the final period .
However , these Council proceedings must be carefully prepared .
This preparatory work , this fin@@ e-@@ tun@@ ing , must not be om@@ itted , ladies and gentlemen of the House . I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful , and that it will not just be limited to technical details .
I think that all of us , the personal representatives of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs , your two representatives , and myself , as a representative of the Commission , will be going into matters in detail , but it will be afterwards , at a different level , one in which we will also be participating , that the last tra@@ de-@@ off@@ s must be made .
Throughout this conference , ladies and gentlemen , it is not only the status of the negoti@@ ators which is important , but the quality of what they will be saying .
And once again I should like to point out in this House , in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam , that whatever the ambigu@@ ity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament , prior to Amsterdam , the quality of what Mrs Gu@@ ig@@ ou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations .
I am sure that the situation will be just the same and , as far as I am concerned , in my current position , I shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations .
I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an ob@@ server at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be .
We now await , therefore , with great interest , ladies and gentlemen of the House , your next opinion , in which you will specify Parliament &apos; s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations .
In the coming months , ladies and gentlemen of the House , the Commission will therefore be working in close cooperation , on good terms , with your two representatives , Professor T@@ sat@@ sos and Mr El@@ mar Brok , in order to re@@ conci@@ le our points of view , if need be .
Quite probably , our points of view and our positions will not always be the same .
There will probably be differences of opinion , that would be only normal .
The important thing is that we are consistent , and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since I accepted the position of Commissioner .
Our concern and our ambition , therefore , on a large number of subjects , is to be on the same wav@@ el@@ eng@@ th and to carry these negotiations forward successfully .
This will not be a matter of chance , since , let me repeat , I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union .
Finally , I should like to make three additional comments , quite briefly , Mr President .
Firstly , to congratulate and thank Mr Na@@ polit@@ ano , the chairman , and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate .
Such dialogue between the national parliaments , the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important .
I have said , furthermore , that I would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments .
Tom@@ orrow , I shall be in London . In a fort@@ night &apos; s time , I shall be in Berlin .
In three weeks &apos; time , I shall be in Paris , and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another .
I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive , and I should like to thank you for taking it .
My second brief comment is to thank the Portuguese Presidency , particularly Mr Sei@@ x@@ as da Costa , for his pro@@ active approach . Indeed , the comments which have just been made express a pro@@ active attitude and a concern which match his own : the Portuguese Presidency cannot be just an interim presidency .
It will have to initiate these negotiations .
We are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency , in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000 . Not only that a conclusion can be reached , but that a successful conclusion can be reached , which is not necessarily the same thing .
Con@@ clu@@ ding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully .
The hand@@ over will have been made , but the conditions in which the hand@@ over is going to be made , by yourself , Mr President , and by the Portuguese Presidency , are going to be extremely important , as is the nature of this hand@@ over .
It is all the work which is going to be carried out together , under your guidance particularly , in the course of these few months , which is extremely important .
We have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency &apos; s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion , and indeed great expectations thereof . Portugal is a small country , but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions .
After having heard Prime Minister Gu@@ terr@@ es , the Minister of Foreign Affairs and yourself , I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely pro@@ active way in which it will conduct these negotiations .
It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months .
Finally , let me repeat , we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popul@@ arise the topics of these negotiations .
These are difficult subjects , subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain .
All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament , Ministers , Commissioners to devote a little time to expl@@ aining matters to the citizens , to public debate .
As far as the Commission is concerned , it will , ladies and gentlemen , be taking initiatives to inau@@ gur@@ ate and or@@ chest@@ rate this public debate .
Cross@@ -@@ border services
- ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to ap@@ olog@@ ise for being a little ho@@ ar@@ se today , but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of expl@@ aining and talking to do .
I would first like to say how in@@ deb@@ ted I am to the Commission for sei@@ zing the initiative , and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today .
It has thereby succeeded in closing two serious lo@@ op@@ holes in the internal market which are of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country nationals in the European Union who are here as workers or on a self-employed basis .
The current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact jud@@ gements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees , I refer in particular to those relating to the Rus@@ h Portugu@@ esa case and that of van der El@@ st .
These have , in fact , clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third-country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross-border services and this without having to obtain work permits .
However , the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue .
Furthermore , not all Member States have ab@@ i@@ ded by the Court of Justice &apos; s ver@@ dic@@ ts with regards to the lap@@ sing of the work permit requirement , and they still have a multip@@ licity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross-border services ; barriers that are often impossible to overcome , especially for the smaller companies .
The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services .
There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here .
Both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU enterprises .
It is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals mod@@ elled on freedom of movement .
All provisions , i.e. issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law per@@ taining to residence rights , should be regarded as anc@@ ill@@ ary to this freedom to provide services .
I , together with the European Parliament &apos; s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , are therefore of the opinion that the Commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view , as expressed in the report produced by the Council &apos; s Legal Service , is inappropriate .
Consequently , I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council &apos; s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned .
I also believe that Parliament &apos; s proposed amendments should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directives as opposed to the Commission &apos; s proposal .
Many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voic@@ ed in the Council , and we are attempting to re@@ conci@@ le these concerns with the task that falls to us by d@@ int of ext@@ ant law and economic good sense .
When it comes to acceptance by the Council , I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible , even if some of them devi@@ ate substantially from the original Commission proposals .
I am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis .
Tur@@ ning now to the most important of our proposed amendments , one of the essential differences is that , in place of a &quot; service provision card plus notification for each individual contract &quot; system , provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract .
This system appears to us to be un@@ suitable in practical terms .
However , in order to compensate for this , all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued , and as the Commission &apos; s proposal would have it , more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued .
An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection , not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months there@@ after .
This should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident .
Likewise , the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued , namely under the terms of an opposition procedure .
What we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States , rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual Member States .
I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs .
I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months , and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting .
However , we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months .
When it comes to self-employed persons , in addition to the amendments already described , we propose that the dom@@ ici@@ le criteria should be made more stringent , and that we should make provision for the possibility of counter@@ ing any abuse in the way of bo@@ g@@ us self-@@ employment .
I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee &apos; s amendments , which they adopted unanimously .
I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quot@@ ing Council decisions .
I must say I have received extremely contradic@@ tory statements from Parliament &apos; s services as to exactly how these Council decisions should be quoted ; whether or not one should use the number or date alone , or both , and how exten@@ sively to quote from them .
Two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report .
I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons .
I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology , i.e. the correct way to quote .
This would make our rapporteur &apos; s life considerably easier in the future .
There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio &apos; s reports .
Unfortunately I have to say that I am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolved on unanimously , and I would like to stand by this outcome , which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions .
On a final note , I would like to thank all those in the Committee who supported me in comp@@ iling these reports , which were far from easy to produce .
I would like to single Mr W@@ iel@@ and out for special mention , for he has the du@@ bi@@ ous honour of being the shadow rapporteur and was involved to a far greater extent than is custom@@ ary in the drawing up of this report , contributing excellent and constructive ideas ; and this without being in a position to receive the pl@@ audi@@ ts awarded a rapporteur .
That is why he deserves special mention !
.
( NL ) Mr President , I am pleased I have been given the opportunity to make a few introduc@@ tory remarks at the end of rapporteur Mrs Ber@@ ger &apos; s speech , after which I will , of course , listen with all due attention to the next speakers .
If you allow me , Mr President , I would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate .
May I say how the Commission welcomes the European Parliament &apos; s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third-country employees , the topic of the debate .
I am extremely grateful for the work that Mrs Ber@@ ger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge .
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
The Commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by Parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards .
If the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more , or all , Member States , the procedure would be more flexible still .
The Commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card .
However , I do not consider a three-@@ month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a Member State .
The Commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employ@@ er is termin@@ ated at short notice .
An efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross-border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market .
It seems over the top to us for other Member States to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards .
Indeed , it should be possible for a third-country subject who has legal status in a Member State to be admitted to other Member States too .
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public-@@ order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification .
Neither does the Commission accept the proposal that legal status in a Member State should be valid three months after the card has exp@@ ired .
Following completion of the service , it is not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service is provided .
That is why the Commission supports Mrs Palacio &apos; s Amendment No 22 in both respects .
As far as the second proposal is concerned , the Commission appreci@@ ates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal .
These are a few introduc@@ tory remarks concerning the key amendments .
I hope that , at the end of the debate , when all the speakers have contributed , I will once again be given the opportunity to elabor@@ ate upon the different amendments .
Mr President , tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , as well as the amended version .
I propose to con@@ fine my comments to two areas .
Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve , that is achieve in the real sense .
There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account .
My comments start from the premis@@ e that we are talking about an u@@ pri@@ ght individual in g@@ ain@@ ful employment .
Then there are the interests of the Member States , which , being on the receiving end , may have to start from the premis@@ e of a worst case scenario .
If we are going to ab@@ ide by the one extreme , that is the interests of the Member States , then we certainly have every reason to make the hur@@ d@@ les that have to be clear@@ ed in applying for this card relatively high .
There is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card .
If I were to go to the other extreme , as few hur@@ d@@ les as possible that is , then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive .
I would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place , but with the hur@@ d@@ les facing the business world being so high , in reality no one would apply for the card .
Altern@@ atively , I might have no directive at all .
Neither outcome would be satisfactory .
Perhaps this is also why , as is ru@@ mo@@ ured to be the case , the Council has become bo@@ g@@ ged down in its negotiations on this as well .
We have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other , that of finding the easi@@ est possible solution .
We want to arrive at a solution where certain hur@@ d@@ les are created vis@@ -@@ à-@@ vis the business world , but once these have been overcome , implementation is as easy as it possibly could be .
Therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more Member States .
If a company in France says that it has an employee who has to work in Denmark on a permanent basis , and only in Denmark , then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for Denmark .
Accordingly , the bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance .
In return for this , however , we want early notification obligations to be dis@@ continued , rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other Member State along with them , and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his / her posting .
Consequently , I too have to say that I am in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
Perhaps there was a certain amount of resi@@ dual mis@@ understanding on the part of the Commission .
We want to achieve a completely flexible solution .
If a particular Member State was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a th@@ eft and the card was for their country , then this particular Member State would be able to re@@ vo@@ ke this card , as it were , for the reasons c@@ ited in this directive , which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution .
Allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter .
Most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers .
We all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty , some of them very old , which are still referred to as EC .
We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law .
However , before the elections we - the Council , the Commission , Parliament , the press , unions and companies that is - worked towards making the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens .
We have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU .
They have now got to gri@@ ps with &quot; EU &quot; .
We would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any fav@@ ours if we were to ch@@ ri@@ sten the product we are proposing to deliver &quot; EC service provision card &quot; and not &quot; EU service provision card &quot; .
It is the world of the EU that the citizens are interested in , this is the one that counts in their eyes .
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction .
Mr President it is later than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this session so I shall be very brief indeed .
One of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this Parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism .
This directive is , of course , not in itself directly about that .
It is about attending to the needs of the internal market , creating flexibility and beh@@ aving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self-employed .
That is in itself also about avoiding being un@@ duly restrictive towards the stran@@ ger simply because he or she is a stran@@ ger .
We welcome that , and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision , we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by Mrs Ber@@ ger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally , which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive , which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council .
Nevertheless , I have tabled an amendment .
Mrs Ber@@ ger , in your Amendment No 2 to Rec@@ ital 6 , you mention legal security .
The first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the resi@@ dency permit , since all that does is create legal in@@ security .
You rightly raise the concern , also expressed by Mr W@@ iel@@ and , at the possibility of workers dis@@ appearing into thin air when their work permits exp@@ ire , but I think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit .
If the validity of the service provision card exp@@ ires on a certain date , it must end on that date .
Legal security requires this .
On the other hand , with regard to point d of Amendment No 10 , which refers to the first directive , you suggest that , for reasons of public security or public order regulations , a Member State may reject the validity of the card .
There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive .
It makes no sense for any worker within the Schengen area , since he or she will already have under@@ gone a screening process in order to enter the first Member State , and the second Member State would be justified in rej@@ ecting ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory .
It therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal in@@ security .
In the case of a non-@@ Schengen state , in the last paragraph of Amendment No 22 , that possibility is contem@@ pl@@ ated , and is perfectly expressed , and I believe this provides greater legal security .
The discre@@ tional power of the State , which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 10 , seems to me to be in@@ consistent with the rest of your excellent report .
I would therefore ask Members to examine my amendment carefully , and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result .
On the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court cases Mrs Ber@@ ger referred to in her opening remarks .
However , in the case of the United Kingdom , we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable .
Par@@ tly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the United Kingdom .
Under the arrangements contained in the Treaties , the United Kingdom re@@ tains its border controls .
Under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation , third country nationals wishing to move to the UK under the procedures described , will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another Member State , thereby by-@@ passing UK border controls .
If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements , that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en pass@@ ant by the European legislative process .
For that reason , we shall vote against both these proposals .
Mr President , Commissioner , first and foremost I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to Mr W@@ iel@@ and for the efforts they have exp@@ ended in su@@ mming up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner .
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services .
The new regulation for cross-border services will doub@@ tless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises .
The strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the EU service provision card - and I am with Mr W@@ iel@@ and on this - are essential , for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bo@@ g@@ us contracts .
Why do I think we need the directive so much ?
Three reasons and they are as follows : on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU , in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market .
Therefore , whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions , I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible .
My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission . Will the directive prejudi@@ ce the accession negotiations ?
How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view , as this will have important implications , notably for the accession negotiations and for our country , which shares common borders with so many applicant countries ?
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms , namely the free movement of people and services , did not apply to them .
Indeed , they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided .
There are approximately thir@@ teen million third-country subjects who res@@ ide within European territory .
I assume that , although the exact number of busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople included in this figure is not known , their number will most definitely not be low .
So , up to now , their access to the entire territory of the Union has not been regulated by Community legislation .
The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card .
It seems important , in this respect , to underline that the service provision card will be issued in a flexible manner , namely within five days of a simple declaration &apos; s having been submitted to a Member State where the service will be provided ; and that , also to prevent mis@@ use , this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extended .
I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner .
Having also studied the amendments submitted , I concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow .
May I , to finish off , thank Mrs Ber@@ ger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having , in that way , added an important degree of meaning to her report ?
I think that , with this report , we are , once again , one step closer to the realis@@ ation of the internal market .
Mr President , thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail .
In the course of my speech , I would also like to address Lord In@@ g@@ le@@ wood regarding the remark he has just made .
Regarding the first proposal on third-country employees , the Commission is prepared to adopt Amendments Nos 2 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 and 22 .
Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too , provided the situation of posting is established in the Member State in which the service provider is established .
The Commission also agrees with Amendment No 11 , except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three months , as I explained just now .
We also welcome Amendment No 13 in@@ sofar as , as a result of this , the card &apos; s area of applic@@ ability is extended from one Member State to all Member States .
In terms of comitology , Amendments Nos 14 and 21 also apply in part , in@@ sofar as the rights of Parliament are concerned .
I regret that the Commission has found Amendment No 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three-@@ month period and the role of the Member State in which the service is provided are concerned .
In this respect , the Commission supports Amendment No 22 , as I have already mentioned . The other amendments are unacceptable .
Person@@ ally , I am rather in favour of the term &quot; EU service provision card &quot; which is proposed in Amendment No 1 , but the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this .
As Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96 / 71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force , no change is necessary .
Acc@@ ept@@ ance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued .
Sur@@ ely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States .
Amendment No 19 is also unacceptable , given my thoughts on Amendment No 10 .
The Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal .
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable .
As far as Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term &quot; self-employed &quot; is concerned , the Commission will , as I have already re@@ marked , provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lo@@ dged .
I would now like to move on to Lord In@@ g@@ le@@ wood &apos; s remark .
He referred to United Kingdom border controls and I would like to say to him that Member States , and this includes the United Kingdom , are under no obligation at all to abo@@ lish or change controls at the existing borders .
This applies , as already stated , to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium , where it was recently of relevance .
With regard to the remark made by Mr Kar@@ as , I am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from Poland being used as employees in his country .
The Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non-@@ EU countries .
The question is , furthermore , one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way .
In my opinion , this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate .
On behalf of the Commission , I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Kar@@ as in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point .
I will keep myself free in this connection .
Finally , I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and , in particular , of course , the rapporteur , Mrs Ber@@ ger .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Bolkestein .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Court of First In@@ stance
Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report , which , on reading it , gives the impression of simply confir@@ ming and accepting the Council &apos; s draft decision .
However , this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results , such as the incorpor@@ ation into the Finnish Presidency &apos; s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to wi@@ den the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation , composition and competences of the Community Cour@@ ts .
For this reason , I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marin@@ ho .
Mr President , the reform of the Community judicial system has become an essential requirement if , in the future , we intend justice to be done within reasonable time sc@@ ales , and if , in the future , the European Union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embark@@ ed upon .
Today - and I must say this with pride and satisfaction - this Parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we Europeans believe that the European political project is much more than just an internal market , and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests .
Beh@@ ind these principles , Mr President , lies the justice system .
However , justice delayed is justice denied , and we must reflect on this notion .
The working document prepared by the Court itself contains alarming information .
For this reason , the draft reform , which has been drawn up by the rapporteur , Vice-President Marin@@ ho , is to be welcomed .
It is true that it is a stop@@ gap solution , but we must rely on stop@@ gap solutions because , at the moment - as he himself has pointed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference .
We have to offer solutions which , while pro@@ visi@@ onal , help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice .
I would like to make two observations during this intervention , which stem from the report itself , given this Parliament &apos; s obligation , in accordance with the Treaty , to produce a very succ@@ inc@@ t report , which does not go into depth .
These are two of Vice-President Marin@@ ho &apos; s ideas and , I believe , they are secon@@ ded by the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
The first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance , and that they should be given one more ré@@ f@@ é@@ ren@@ da@@ ire .
The second is that the translation services of the Court of First In@@ stance and the Court of Justice should be separated .
At the moment , the Court of First In@@ stance has to wait a very long time for its jud@@ gements to be translated .
According to the Treaty , one of the founding principles of this Community is linguistic and cultural plur@@ ality and there is no question of our overlooking the possibility of something as important as being able to read a jud@@ gement in our own language .
Since we are talking about the Intergovernmental Conference , let us consider just two points .
The first concerns this Parliament .
I believe that it is well worth insi@@ sting that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice , even in the appointment of judges .
Above all , we wish to see an extension of the competences of the Court of Justice , hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations , in other words , its resources .
We wish to see its competences extended , especially within Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community and with regard to Chapter VI of the Treaty on European Union and also a review of certain possible options , certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens .
And I refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report .
It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency .
Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice .
The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not t@@ olls on it should be subject to VAT .
The decision could have huge implications for our local economy .
Secondly there is a lady within thir@@ teen weeks of retirement who is desper@@ ate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age .
These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe &apos; s system of justice .
Del@@ ays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy .
This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect , but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court .
Amon@@ gst the statistics there is a worrying up@@ ward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references .
This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff , rather of the Court &apos; s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union .
The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim p@@ alli@@ ative , but Europe is a legal construction , its courts are central to its proper functioning .
In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system .
Otherwise we will all , as elected representatives , be faced with more and more cl@@ am@@ our from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice .
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report .
I also fully endorse his findings , in which , in particular , he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First In@@ stance and providing the latter with its own translation service .
However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here .
For example , I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First In@@ stance that of Last In@@ stance , if applicable , and making this a final competence , in those sp@@ heres where ben@@ ches of the Court , which res@@ emble courts , pass jud@@ gement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law .
I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission &apos; s inc@@ lin@@ ation to ren@@ ation@@ alise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level .
It seems to me that we need to give this some thought , as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First In@@ stance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions .
We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind .
Where possible , one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First In@@ stance .
On a final note , I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law .
As things stand , OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it ple@@ ases .
It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court .
The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First In@@ stance .
That would be another way of sp@@ ur@@ ring the reform process on .
Mr President , I would like to begin by joining those who congrat@@ ulated the rapporteur on this work .
The European Union is a system based on law .
It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law .
Furthermore , if the courts cannot deal appropriately and ex@@ pedi@@ ti@@ ously with the legal work@@ load placed on them , what happens , as Mad@@ ame Palacio Vall@@ eler@@ sun@@ di has already pointed out , is that justice delayed becomes , as we know , justice denied .
The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to allevi@@ ate the problem .
However , as Mr Marin@@ ho has pointed out , more is necessary , but that has to wait for the IGC ,
In my own country , myth@@ ology tells of the te@@ em@@ ing hor@@ des of fac@@ eless Brussels bure@@ au@@ cr@@ ats but it never men@@ tions the number of European judges .
There are less than three do@@ zen at the ap@@ ex of the European judicial order - hardly an over@@ load given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system .
The extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding An@@ gl@@ o / French dispute over British beef which has caused such anger in my country and such fru@@ stration with the work@@ ings of the Union &apos; s disputes resolution procedures .
This has been compo@@ unded , so some who advise me believe , by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well ni@@ gh impossible for non-@@ French nationals to proceed against the French Government .
Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible .
This contra@@ sts most un@@ favour@@ ably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable .
What is happening in France , Mr President , appears pri@@ ma fac@@ ie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties .
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner , who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate , to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings .
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this .
Mr President , on behalf of Commission President , Mr Prodi , I would like to respond as follows .
May I add that , on behalf of the Commission , I listened with great interest to the ple@@ as which have been made just now and that I have a great deal of sympathy for the un@@ ease which under@@ lies these ple@@ as .
The un@@ ease is justified .
It has been said more than once : justice delayed is justice denied .
The Commission sympath@@ ises with these considerations . In the light of this sympathy , I would like to continue my response as follows .
As your Parliament is aware , the Commission is convinced that , without fundamental reform , the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines .
Consequently , the Commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the enti@@ re@@ ty of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First In@@ stance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades .
The Commission is aware of the request made by the Court of First In@@ stance to increase its number of judges , but at the moment , the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which I have just mentioned .
In other words , once this study is complete , the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
Exc@@ ep@@ tional financial aid to Kosovo
The next item is the report ( A5-00@@ 22 / 2000 ) by Mr Brok , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo ( COM ( 99 ) 0@@ 5@@ 98 - C@@ 5-00@@ 45 / 00 - 1999 / 0@@ 240 ( CNS ) ) .
I have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes .
I propose that we start the debate immediately .
He will join us and speak as soon as he arri@@ ves .
I therefore give the floor immediately to Mr Bour@@ langes , in his capacity as dra@@ ftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets .
Mr President , this is an important and urgent matter , and Parliament is compl@@ ying with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quickly , because today , you must realise , men and women are dying in Kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero , these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid .
An urgent request has been referred to us , and we approve it .
We have been asked for EUR 35 million .
We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigil@@ ant in ensuring , once the decision has been taken , that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible . We are talking about macro@@ financial aid .
There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal can@@ ons of beauty which sti@@ p@@ ulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration .
This is not our opinion .
Our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in Kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region .
Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the dis@@ integration of that state .
The second important problem is that we have been asked for payments , the donors have made commitments and , obviously , we are the only ones actually paying .
The other parties are not paying .
We wish to see an end to this one-@@ si@@ ded situation regarding requests for financial aid .
We would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this .
We would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors .
This is not in order to limit or be st@@ ing@@ y with our financial contribution to Kosovo but , quite the contrary , to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors .
From that point of view , the proposed facility is a two-@@ phase aid facility and the second tran@@ che must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest .
Finally , we have three questions for the Commission in this regard . Firstly , we need the Commission to give us , on a regular basis , the list and the amounts that other donors contribute .
When we come to pay , we want to know what the others are paying .
Secondly , we wish to see an exact progress report on the inv@@ itations to tender and the schedule for their implementation .
During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet , according to our information , no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date .
This is serious , since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo .
Finally , and this follows on from what I have just said , we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis , monthly , regarding progress on payments made .
We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments .
It is not firm commitments that we need , just plain commitments would suff@@ ice , and we need to know what has actually been paid and , more especially , what has not been paid .
Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment .
Mr President , if we are going to discuss Kosovo today , as we have done many times before , then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo , or of whether in fact anything has been done at all .
What I mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to norm@@ ality , and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate .
As of 9 February , there will be something known as the Kosovo Tran@@ si@@ tional Council , which will comp@@ rise representatives of the political parties , the minorities and civil society , and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament .
This is a positive move and we welcome it , but I believe we need to equi@@ p the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare , for elections are planned for the autumn .
No one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result .
No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis@@ -@@ à-@@ vis UN@@ M@@ IK .
In other words , there are quite a few imp@@ onder@@ ables that we are not being informed about and that others are presum@@ ably unable to get to gri@@ ps with properly either .
Of all people , it is the Alb@@ ani@@ ans , who are now being integrated into the transitional council , who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them .
In addition to financial out@@ lay and reconstruction work , urgent attention must also be given to restoring the co@@ existence of Ser@@ bs , Alb@@ ani@@ ans and other minorities - not for@@ getting the Roma of course - in this country , so that at some point in the near future , on the road to co@@ existence , it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place .
I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about .
Administr@@ ation-@@ wise there are now 34 tax inspec@@ tors .
That is excellent news !
There too , people are being encouraged to pay their taxes , for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on hand@@ outs from the EU and from other donors ; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources .
It should also be noted that of the 19 departments , 4 already have administrative leadership , which represents an improvement on the situation there hi@@ therto .
There is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law .
We have 130 judges and public prosec@@ ut@@ ors , who have now been s@@ worn in , and who are ready to take up their work of disp@@ ens@@ ing justice , with a view to enrich@@ ing the culture of tolerance there a little , and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convic@@ tions .
Another positive development I would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UC@@ K is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country .
I believe that is a good thing
I wholly endorse what the Committee on Budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the Commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way .
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything .
It is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the Four@@ th P@@ illar , but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay Mr K@@ ou@@ chner &apos; s outstanding b@@ ills .
One could do so once or twice , but I feel that the UN donors should contribute to this as well , for there is a very large hole , as yet un@@ filled , that we are unable to fill .
We have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it .
Mr President , I would like to offer a few explanations .
In a debate , there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said .
However , I would like to concentrate on two points .
Firstly , I would like to make it very clear that the Union is the main contribut@@ or to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo .
I would like to point out to Mrs Alb@@ right that what we have read recently in the press is true , and that figures do not lie .
Let us make this clear , however much some people may not wish to believe it .
The Union has decided to assist with a further EUR 35 million in additional macro@@ financial aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo , on the basis of an IMF report which estimates that a further EUR 115 million is needed for that reconstruction .
I would like to say to Mrs Pack that I am in complete agreement with her when she says that the Commission should insist that other contribut@@ ors fulfil their commitments .
I would also like to express my concern - which is very considerable - at the statement by some Ministers at the last Eco@@ fin that says that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to alter , in any circumstances , the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin .
This calls into question the agreement which Parliament reached , with great difficulty , with the Council in December , according to which , when the Commission presents a multi@@ annual programme for reconstruction , the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary .
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach .
I would like to ask the Commission - and I am glad that Commissioner Sol@@ bes is here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multi@@ annual finance programme , with the corresponding report , requested by Parliament , so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up , as we have been promised .
Lastly , I would like to insist that , although we have agreed to EUR 35 million now , we know that this is a stop@@ gap solution and that it is not enough , and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multi@@ annual reconstruction programme for Kosovo , which is so badly needed .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , please excuse my late arrival , but this other political issue is still on the agenda today , more is the pity .
The Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million , and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need .
The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there .
However , this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process .
Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents .
Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions .
I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future .
It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to over@@ look this .
However , we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here .
One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims . In other words , we should ensure that the money falls to Mr K@@ ou@@ chner &apos; s sphere of competence and not to other sp@@ heres .
Secondly , even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there , we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into .
This mission is being conducted under the au@@ sp@@ ices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations .
It is no less inc@@ umb@@ ent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame , in the interests of the persons affected .
This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensi@@ vely with this issue in general terms , that is to say , not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-@@ east Europe , and with the aid delivered there .
This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence .
We have so many coordin@@ ators , who , in turn , are responsible to so many employers , that we will soon have to employ a coordin@@ ator for the coordin@@ ators .
Perhaps it would be better , however , if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations , were to get together some time to introduce a uniform , coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there .
I know that the Commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this , but if the European Union is doing the most work out there , then it should also be given the leadership , and bring coherence to the situation , so that we can be of real assistance to the people .
It makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground !
Mr President , when the Alliance interven@@ ed in Kosovo its objective was to re-@@ establish conditions in this province which would enable those who wished to do so to stay there or return , with respect for their own heritage and their own culture .
If the Alliance is still active in that region , it is with the same objective .
The day before yesterday I was pleased to hear an interview given by the K@@ FOR comm@@ ander showing how much better matters in connection with this in Kosovo were starting to be , particularly as regards security , crime levels had been restored to an acceptable level .
Those representing Europe who are active at the grass roots level in pursuing this objective , and I am thinking in particular of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , are on the ver@@ ge of des@@ pon@@ dency precisely because , since matters are improving , there is less talk of Kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which is needed there is becoming less apparent .
We must work to ensure that , in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally , the rule of sh@@ op@@ ke@@ ep@@ ers follows the rule of the war@@ l@@ ords .
It is true that economic aid is , in this respect , certainly an essential element to the scope of action affor@@ ded those people active at the grass roots level .
Let me reiterate the comment which Dor@@ is Pack has just made and stress that we , the Members of the European Parliament , must fulfil our own obligations in this regard , while ensuring , of course , that we are not the only ones to do so .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Brok , for his report .
If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on .
The Council &apos; s fail@@ ings in this respect are a source of much regret .
The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premis@@ e that we should , and must , provide help swif@@ tly , however it is also right to start from the premis@@ e that we will not provide help in@@ definitely or at random .
I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point , which clearly emphasises that it is only possible , and per@@ missible , to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Koso@@ van budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-@@ public , commun@@ al and other authorities and institutions , which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UN@@ M@@ IK .
Commissioner , it must be made clear that we support UN@@ M@@ IK and the institutions set up by the United Nations , in particular P@@ illar 4 of course , and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place .
What is to be done with this money ?
I would like to highlight the issue of human rights .
The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today ?
We were able to put a stop to the mass exp@@ ul@@ sion campaign carried out by the Ser@@ bs but almost every day in@@ support@@ able things happen : people are killed , people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit .
Every single day there are attacks on Ser@@ bs , on the Roma , on Bosni@@ ans , but attacks are also still carried out on Alb@@ ani@@ ans .
I was in fact sho@@ cked to read in the report , assuming this is true , how an Alb@@ anian doctor , who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mit@@ ro@@ vi@@ ca under what must have been great difficulties , ultimately had to give up helping his k@@ ins@@ men in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life .
These are events and situations that cannot be toler@@ ated .
I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Ser@@ bs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo .
There are , at the very least , ru@@ mo@@ urs that Serbian mili@@ ti@@ as are up to their old tri@@ cks again .
It is ir@@ relevant , as far as I am concerned , as to whether it is Ser@@ bs , Roma , Bosni@@ ans or Alb@@ ani@@ ans who are threatened or killed in Kosovo .
It is also ir@@ relevant , in my view , as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo .
What is all-@@ important , to my mind , is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve , a multi-@@ ethnic Kosovo that is , a Kosovo where people can live together .
We need more police officers , as we have no@@ where near enough .
We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish - , we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights .
All of this needs to happen , and quickly too .
If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deterior@@ ate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise .
That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly , to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available .
Only , now we want to see this translate into de@@ eds and we also want to see success in Kosovo , and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use , notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary .
.
( ES ) Mr President , I would like firstly to thank the Members , and especially the rapporteur , for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue .
This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned .
I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight &apos; s debate .
Firstly , although much progress has been made , and we could mention customs administration , bank administration or tax administration , it is true that we must continue to move forward .
However , in moving forward , what should we be financing ?
This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of dis@@ agreement .
In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with Union funds , for example , Amendments Nos 3 and 5 .
In our view , however , in both respects , greater room for manoeu@@ vre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which , on the ground , is more aware of the reality than we are .
We believe that to pre@@ judge , at the moment , where resources should be directed , would create more practical difficulties .
In short , we should put our faith in those parties who , in these areas , are better equipped than us to make certain decisions .
The second concern which I notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by Mr Bour@@ langes , but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors .
Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate ?
Some of the amendments in your report pose this question .
For example , Amendments Nos 1 , 2 and 4 .
I would say to Mr Bour@@ langes and to those who have raised this issue , that this is not the fundamental problem , although we recognise it totally .
The fundamental problem is that , at the moment , the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the High Level Ste@@ ering Group , but it is also true that they have no legal status . This is simply a political commitment .
That is the reason why , while accepting its spirit , we would ask that Amendment No 1 be wor@@ ded differently - and we have sent a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it does not imp@@ ly condi@@ tionality in the provision of Community resources .
I would say the same about Amendment No 2 , which we would also accept with a slight modification , since the idea seems to us to be basically correct .
Amendment No 4 is of a similar nature . On this specific point , we can perhaps offer Mr Bour@@ langes greater satisfaction .
We have already spoken to the Council so that it might include a Commission statement in its decision , establishing this element of condi@@ tionality .
With regard to the second contribution , what we propose is that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decided in accordance with the external financial needs of Kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors .
In other words , we should not establish condi@@ tionality , or we believe that it is more effective not to establish condi@@ tionality from the start , but , nevertheless , we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage .
In this way , we would have no problem in acting immediately . We would not create problems for the Koso@@ var people , but , on the other hand , we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing .
A third problem has been raised by Mrs D@@ ühr@@ k@@ op with regard to the multi@@ annual programmes .
I would remind you that these projects are multi@@ annual .
The programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account .
Lastly , I would like to make some observations on the requests for additional information which have been addressed to us .
On the one hand , we have been asked to provide Parliament with information regarding the progress of inv@@ itations to tender and , in this respect , I can tell you that the Commission was last week able to provide Parliament &apos; s Committee on Budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments carried out since the task force was sent into action in Kosovo .
The Commission can commit itself to regularly inform@@ ing Parliament of the inv@@ itations to tender which are published .
We also wish to see these public@@ ised on the Internet , so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point .
A second point which I would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to Parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance .
In this respect I would like to tell you that the Commission is prepared to keep the chair@@ men of the various committees involved in this area regularly informed , on a confidential basis , if the nature of the information provided requires confidentiality , on the different schemes being implemented for macroeconomic assistance .
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen , and I hope that , with the final decision of the Council , we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in Kosovo by different parties , so that we might achieve that situation of greater co@@ existence and peace which we all wish to see .
Mr President , I am pleased to see the convergence of view@@ points there is between Parliament , particularly the Committee on Budgets , and the Commission , and we can assure you that , for our part , we shall always be there to assist the Commission in the performance of its duties .
I do , however , have one small concern , when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the Committee on Budgets .
There was a clear agreement , good or bad I will not say , but there was a contract . There was a clear understanding between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was agreement on Amendments 4 and 7 , i.e. on the idea of linking the mobili@@ sation , the implementation , of the second tran@@ che of macro@@ financial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment .
But , if I understand what Mr Sol@@ bes Mir@@ a says correctly , then this undertaking was only a t@@ entative one .
Commissioner , an agreement is an agreement .
Can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the Committee on Budgets , yes or no ? Or are you going to drop this pro@@ vis@@ o , thus breaking the undertaking made to us ?
No , Mr Bour@@ langes , I think it is a substan@@ tive problem .
The problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted .
What I proposed to you , and what I still say , is that the Commission will make a statement , in the Council Decision , something like this :
The exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tran@@ che will be decided in due course taking into account developments in Kosovo &apos; s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors .
With this , we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed .
I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tran@@ che .
I agree , absolutely . We shall do so .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
AL@@ TEN@@ ER
The next item is the report ( A5-00@@ 11 / 2000 ) by Mr Lan@@ gen , on the joint text approved by the Conci@@ liation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multi@@ annual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Al@@ tener ( C5-0@@ 3@@ 33 / 1999 - 1997 / 0@@ 3@@ 70 ( COD ) )
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Lan@@ gen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council .
The project has been long and problematic .
In future too , there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources .
Although there is much that is good about the new directive , it is nonetheless not without its defects .
One example is the use of pe@@ at .
Pe@@ at cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels .
If pe@@ at cannot be classified directly as a renewable , non-@@ fossil energy source , it must form its own class , especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned .
It is not right that pe@@ at should be judged according to the same criteria as , for example , coal .
The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union &apos; s dependence on imported energy .
Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU &apos; s next round of enlargement .
Dep@@ endence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries , whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy .
The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate .
We are all concerned about the environment and our children &apos; s future .
The share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased , but it has to be done in a rational manner .
We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renew@@ ables for a long time to come .
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate : nuclear energy .
Mr President , on behalf of the PSE Group , I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the AL@@ TEN@@ ER II Programme .
Firstly , however , I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Lan@@ gen , for the truly excellent work he has done on this report .
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conci@@ liation Committee , Mr Pro@@ van .
For as Mr Lan@@ gen said just now , we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conci@@ liation Committee .
However , we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout .
Mr Lan@@ gen mentioned that a series of Parliament &apos; s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council hal@@ f@@ way on even the most con@@ ten@@ tious point , that of the financing for this multi@@ annual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community .
This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear .
However , we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed .
For in the course of the next few years , the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double , accounting for at least 12 % of energy consumption .
This is the European Union &apos; s declared aim .
That being the case , since AL@@ TEN@@ ER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources , it will certainly be have a key role .
In the first place , this new five-@@ year programme will ent@@ ail extending the actions in the AL@@ TEN@@ ER I programme .
This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector , developing local and regional energy agencies , and establishing new networks for appro@@ ving financial support , to name but a few examples .
To my mind though , what is particularly important about the AL@@ TEN@@ ER II programme are the new actions for rel@@ iev@@ ing market sat@@ ur@@ ation by renewable energies and those for implementing , supporting and monitoring the Community strategy and the Community action plan .
We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission &apos; s services on a break@@ through campaign , which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy .
It contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors .
It is very important for this AL@@ TEN@@ ER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it .
The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion .
75 % -@@ 80 % of this is to come from private sources , and this will be suppl@@ emented by public funds from the Member States and from the regions .
In this respect , the AL@@ TEN@@ ER programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment , and help us to realise our ambition , in the interests of environmental protection , the economy and creating new jobs .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank Mr Lan@@ gen for his excellent work in this important matter .
The conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the Al@@ tener programme as put forward by the Conci@@ liation Committee is , after all the difficult phases it has been through , at least satisfactory .
Most of Parliament &apos; s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to EUR 77 million must be seen as positive .
The Union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy .
There is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets , however .
The appropriations are needed for pilot projects , research , information exchange and also to cultiv@@ ate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy .
The main responsibility for increasing the use of renew@@ ables is to be borne by the Member States .
This programme will hopefully encourage Member States to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy .
However , in the future , the Union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market .
Pro@@ mot@@ ing the use of renew@@ ables is especially important for the environment .
The Union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renew@@ ables is actively step@@ ped up .
Ren@@ ew@@ able energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boo@@ sts competitiveness .
Europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy .
We should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment .
May I also venture to raise the matter of pe@@ at ?
Pe@@ at is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources .
However , it is important , at least in Finland , as a sustain@@ ably used , slowly renewable energy source .
I hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renew@@ ables .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance are pleased with the agreement which has been found , and their thanks go to all those who negotiated so well in favour of an amendment which the Greens were almost the authors of .
It is interesting for me , as a new Member of Parliament , to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco cultivation .
This is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale .
In contrast with that , I see the amounts allocated for renewable energies , which are not only an ecological element but which look set to under@@ go considerable economic expansion .
Se@@ eing the market share that small countries such as Denmark have been capable of acqu@@ iring in this field , because they were the first ones to develop that area , gives one food for thought , I feel , and I think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies .
One last word regarding the programme . I think it very important for renewable energies to be firmly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there .
In order to ensure that at least 50 % of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources , it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term .
Mr President , may I comm@@ ence by complim@@ enting Mr Lan@@ gen on his work .
The activities of the AL@@ TEN@@ ER programme will promote renewable energy sources and I believe that such programmes merit financial support at the develop@@ mental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future .
For this reason , I am particularly pleased to see the mon@@ ies foc@@ uss@@ ed on projects by small and medium-sized enterprises .
The internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone . In this regard , it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national re@@ mit .
It is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renew@@ ables .
I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend £ 125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector .
I would hope that the contribution of AL@@ TEN@@ ER would lead to more initiatives .
As the final text rightly states , actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities .
I can vou@@ ch that I have already received significant interest in the AL@@ TEN@@ ER programme from my own constituency of L@@ ein@@ ster , a significant portion of which falls within Ireland &apos; s only Objective I region .
I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infra@@ structural provisions , including the energy sector .
In short , we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol , while at the same time promoting growth in our economies .
AL@@ TEN@@ ER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States .
Mr President , Mr Lan@@ gen , ladies and gentlemen , as our rapporteur mentioned , we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the Council on the AL@@ TEN@@ ER programme .
Mr Lan@@ gen mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the Council was initially FF 74 million , whereas the Commission proposed 8@@ 1.1 million , a figure which the European Parliament supported .
An initial conciliation meeting was not successful , because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1.@@ 9 million .
We could not agree with a proposal like this , which challeng@@ ed the authority of the European Parliament .
A second round of conciliation achieved an increase of EUR 1.1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million .
In fact , renewable energies un@@ question@@ ably provide a way of achieving these objectives .
However , in spite of the reservations I am expressing on the pau@@ city of the financial allocation , I personally support the compromise , by virtue of the programme &apos; s content , to which the European Parliament made an active contribution as , following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty , this sector become subject to codecision .
It is practically certain that , with the raft of proposed measures and actions , it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12 % renewable energy share by 2010 , dou@@ bling the current rate , as long as the appropriations including state appropriations are made available .
This programme , together with the SA@@ VE II programme , integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy , establishes a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence .
And , in conclusion , Mr President , let me also insist upon the fact that , in addition to the measures proposed , there are also legislative measures and , most especially , adequate budget al@@ locations to back up these political initiatives .
And I shall end , of course , by congratulating Mr Lan@@ gen , our rapporteur , on his work , as well as all the members of the committee and of the Conci@@ liation Committee .
.
( ES ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached on the AL@@ TEN@@ ER II programme in the Conci@@ liation Committee and associ@@ ate myself with the comments of the different speakers and , of course , point out that this agreement will allow the AL@@ TEN@@ ER programme to be incorporated soon into the framework energy programme .
All of this will provide greater coordination , transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes , into which we will also have to incorporate the SA@@ VE programme , which we will be discussing soon .
I would like to say that the work carried out during this time by Parliament has been of a high quality , and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Lan@@ gen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary .
Obviously , there have been arguments , we had to go to conciliation , as the rapporteur and Mr Cau@@ dr@@ on reminded us a moment ago , since at the first meeting no result was achieved , and there had to be a second meeting , despite the fact that the figures were not excessive .
However , I believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement , which , like all agreements , is perhaps not perfect , but which , I believe , allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing .
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Lan@@ gen , on his work , to thank the speakers and , of course , to acknowledge the actions of Vice-President Pro@@ van throughout the conciliation procedure , who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result .
I would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the Council .
SA@@ VE
The next item is the report ( A5-00@@ 10 / 2000 ) by Mrs Ah@@ ern , on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conci@@ liation Committee , on the joint text approved by the Conci@@ liation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multi@@ annual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SA@@ VE ( C5-0@@ 3@@ 34 / 1999 - 1997 / 0@@ 3@@ 71 ( COD ) ) .
Madam President , I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was goo@@ d-@@ tem@@ pered all round , which is not always the case .
I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-@@ wor@@ ded form .
The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council &apos; s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there .
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SA@@ VE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading .
I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments , including a re-@@ in@@ statement of the Commission &apos; s original budget .
The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable .
During the procedure , agreement was reached on the studies and actions to de@@ vise , implement , complement and assess the Community measures .
Com@@ promise wor@@ dings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-@@ legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and , very importantly , the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency .
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress .
The issue of the financial en@@ velop@@ e was staun@@ ch@@ ly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council &apos; s very me@@ ag@@ re opening offer .
In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount .
We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under .
This was an important consideration for us .
I would like to say however that it is , and has always been , a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real .
Fund@@ ing for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States .
We have to bear that in mind when appro@@ ving this programme .
If there is more symboli@@ sm than reality in what we can achieve at Community level , this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action , including Community actions , on energy saving .
Where the Community can step in is to put the local activ@@ ators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-@@ inv@@ ent the wheel in every region .
We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard .
SA@@ VE is the only Commun@@ ity-@@ wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy .
It focuses on non-@@ technical elements , helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure , and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted .
Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings .
We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency sav@@ es money for business , sav@@ es money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-@@ problem@@ ati@@ cal .
It is something that we can all support .
I have to say , like mo@@ ther@@ hood , although we all support it , sometimes we do very little substantially and con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-@@ saving .
We could do rather more , considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports .
We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see .
We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change .
If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do .
I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process .
As Mrs Ah@@ ern has explained very well , the budgets of both the SA@@ VE programme and the AL@@ TEN@@ ER programme , are basically symbolic budgets , since the burden is shoul@@ dered by the countries , the States of the Union , the regions or even , in some cases , the local authorities .
Furthermore , behind these programmes , that is to say , the SA@@ VE programme , which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings , and the Al@@ tener programme , which concerns renewable energy , there lies an extremely important technological challenge , which , from an economic point of view , may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole .
With regard to the parliamentary procedure , I would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken , especially the rapporteur , because the majority of Parliament &apos; s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council , in this case practically all of them , although with some modifications . I would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved .
This improvement has been achieved with fresh funds , as we said at the time , and it has been achieved while safeguarding this Parliament &apos; s prer@@ og@@ atives and competences .
From the point of view of the Commission , in this interinstitutional game , I believe that this is important and I am very happy to highlight it .
I would like once again to thank all the speakers , and also , especially , the Vice-President , Mr Pro@@ van , for his magnificent work throughout this debate , particularly during the conciliation procedure , as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry and , also , above all , the rapporteur , Mrs Ah@@ ern , and all the Members who have participated in this work .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
C@@ UL@@ T@@ UR@@ E 2000
The next item is the report ( A5-00@@ 09 / 2000 ) by Mr Gra@@ ça M@@ our@@ a , on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conci@@ liation Committee , on the joint text approved by the Conci@@ liation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ( &apos; Culture 2000 &apos; ) ( C5-0@@ 3@@ 27 / 1999 - 1998 / 0@@ 16@@ 9 ( COD ) ) .
Madam President , I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate .
Unfortunately , there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to al@@ locate any money for it .
We have the feeling , and are in fact convinced , that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht .
For no one is very keen to spend money on culture .
S@@ adly that is the case and we must face facts .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , who really has chi@@ pped away ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly at this monum@@ ental task , in conjunction with the Commissioner of course .
We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually at@@ tained our goal in terms of content , of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect .
One seems power@@ less in a dialogue of this kind , where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision .
What kind of hor@@ se-@@ trading system is this ? Certainly not a fair one !
There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side , beg@@ ging for a little more money for culture .
It is down@@ right sc@@ andal@@ ous what goes on !
It is an aw@@ ful sort of hor@@ se-@@ trading , based on un@@ equal positions !
Nevertheless , we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to .
It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us .
We will support small and medium-sized events , not the large ones , and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access . I believe that the fact that Culture and , fitt@@ ingly , Education and Youth now fall within the same Commissioner &apos; s re@@ mit , will also serve to guarantee more syn@@ ergy between these three programmes , which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the European Union .
If one puts all the money together and creates syn@@ ergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied , but then only a tiny bit .
It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of syn@@ ergy with a little money .
Madam President , I agree with the fine words with which the rapporteur began his intervention and I must add that , during the conciliation procedure , I was personally a little disappointed with the Council .
On the one hand , it continued to refuse to accept the term &quot; European cultural policy &quot; or other similar terms , even under@@ valu@@ ing the terms of the Treaty , and it defines &quot; Culture 2000 &quot; simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more .
On the other hand , it has shown complete in@@ transi@@ gence with regard to the funds requested by this Parliament , which were minimal anyway .
In@@ ci@@ dentally , this last point would be unfair to four@@ teen Members of the Council , since it was just one , the Netherlands , which was responsible for that in@@ transi@@ gence .
It has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is in@@ compatible with the demand for unanimity in the Council .
This demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution .
However , Madam President , these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow , and which the Socialists will vote in favour of , will put in place one of the European Union &apos; s most important programmes .
By taking action in the field of culture , we are directly contributing to the construction of a European soul , especially given the fact that the sub-@@ programmes which make up &quot; Culture 2000 &quot; are superb .
In recent years , these have been amongst the programmes most eag@@ erly accepted by the yo@@ ung@@ est and most dynamic citizens of the European Union .
Lastly , I would like to mention the pro@@ found@@ ly human impression I have formed of the rapporteur , Mr Gra@@ ça M@@ our@@ a : his knowledge , his sense of balance , his intellectual qualities , make him , in my opinion , the best possible rapporteur this report could have had .
Con@@ grat@@ ulations !
Finally , I would like to congratulate Commissioner Reding , Vice-President Im@@ ben@@ i and Mr Gar@@ gan@@ i , chairman of the Committee on Culture , for the firm and intelligent position which , each within his own role , they have maintained during the entire conciliation process .
Madam President , Commissioner , rapporteur , I would like to start by thanking Mr Gra@@ ça M@@ our@@ a most warmly for the tremendous efforts he has put into the discussion of this Culture 2000 programme .
It has been said before , and we have discussed this between ourselves on various occasions , that culture is , of course , extremely important as an area unto itself - I would like to stress this once again - but also as the instrument par excellence for fur@@ ther@@ ing the European idea .
It is also of great importance to citizens .
We should , above all , not lose sight of this .
The impetus given to the European idea by this programme is having an enormous impact , especially on small linguistic areas such as the Netherlands which not only has national potential , but is also rel@@ ying on support from the programme , mainly from a language point of view .
Today , we have arrived at the end of a long road .
I would nonetheless like , as others have done , to touch upon the procedure , which is unclear and , above all , un@@ wanted .
Co@@ decision and unanimity do not go hand in hand .
They are like a sn@@ ake bit@@ ing its own tail .
There is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states be@@ foreh@@ and : anything is open for discussion , as long as the budget stays fixed .
As it happens - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage .
The result is 30 % growth , so we are not completely dis@@ satisfied with the result .
Of course , it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and I for one will always advocate this - but I do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes .
I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot .
Culture does not only fall under the b@@ anner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas .
A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds , and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind .
Fortunately , I am on the Committee on Regional Policy . So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention .
I think that we have also op@@ ted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because , if it happens to be cancelled , then surely this does not benefit the citizen .
I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect .
However , I do think that it is necessary , as he always states too , that , in the next IGC , changes will be made to codecision , when unanimity will no longer be necessary .
We are very positive about the many improvements which have been made : no more meg@@ a-@@ projects , room for cultural networks , and sufficient attention to promoting reading , transl@@ ating and translation companies .
This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas . I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000 .
All that remains for me to say is : time to get down to business .
Madam President , all that I wanted to say has been covered by those fellow Members who spoke before me and I think there is unanimity among the groups in the European Parliament and among those of us on the Committee on Culture .
I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart .
Not because our delegation , our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gar@@ gan@@ i did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong obj@@ ection to Commissioner Reding &apos; s attitude - I think that , given the framework she was operating in , her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council .
It is sham@@ eful !
That figure of EUR 16@@ 7 million for so many years is a dis@@ grace for the European Union !
So long as we continue to have unanimity , so long as yesterday the Dutch Government was able to impose those EUR 16@@ 7 million as an ultim@@ atum and so long as a government with Mr Hai@@ der will soon be telling us what cultural activities we can pursue , we will never progress .
That is why it is very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decisions and to cut free so that the European Parliament &apos; s efforts to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the European area may be rid of this constra@@ int by all the governments .
Madam President , I absolutely agree with the rapporteur &apos; s analysis and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Culture , Mr Gar@@ gan@@ i , for his pra@@ is@@ e@@ worthy work in a medi@@ ation process that was also , considerably difficult .
Of course , we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programmes , but everyone hoped that the Culture programme could help to promote , for example , the unique features of each cultural sector , even - and I could say especially - of the unique features of less well-known sectors .
We hope that this , at the least , will come about during the evaluation process .
We sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action , among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social , as well as economic , development of a people .
And a fully-@@ fle@@ dged Europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully re@@ discover its roots , highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well-known .
The overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens : this is why we believe that the Culture 2000 programme , albeit with a scar@@ city of funds , can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal .
Madam President , I will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that I support the adoption of Culture 2000 and add my thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Gra@@ ça M@@ our@@ a , who took over from our former colleague N@@ ana Mou@@ sk@@ our@@ i .
Both of them have done a first-class job .
Al@@ ongside the debate we had earlier on in the day , culture may not seem that important , but it is ; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important .
Why do I say that culture is important ?
Well in simple economic terms , Europe &apos; s culture adds to genuine prosperity .
Where would Europe &apos; s tourism industry be without the rich@@ ness of our culture ?
But , more importantly than that , cultural activities are what make mankind civili@@ sed .
Culture is at the root of our democratic belief@@ s ; and an un@@ cul@@ tured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy .
Cultural diversity is important , and it is under threat .
However , it is not under threat from Europe .
Many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat , for example , from Portugal , from Germany , from Finland , for heav@@ en &apos; s sake .
We do drink port wine , and we do like German beer , and we even use Finnish sa@@ unas , but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat .
What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Co@@ ca Col@@ a , eating ham@@ bur@@ gers , wearing bas@@ eb@@ all cap@@ s , watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time .
Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe &apos; s culture , but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can .
That is what Culture 2000 is about .
So , I say to the Council of Ministers : Keep this programme genuinely under review .
Are we doing enough ?
And , I say to Mad@@ ame Reding , thank you for the support and the help you have given so far , keep up the good work , we are on your side .
Madam President , I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur , Gra@@ a M@@ our@@ a , and Commissioner Reding , for their contribution to the creation of this programme .
The Culture 2000 programme was fin@@ alised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council .
The outcome can be considered reasonable , when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme called for a unanimous decision to be made in the Council .
We have to hope that at the forthcoming IGC we will also end up with qualified majority decisions in the area of culture .
It is really strange that legislation that adher@@ es to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the Council .
The framework programme on culture is replacing the present Kal@@ ei@@ do@@ scope , Ari@@ ane and Rap@@ ha@@ el programmes .
When implementation of the programme begins , I hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utili@@ sed to the full .
I believe and hope that , despite the ass@@ ault on us all of the new technology , literature will maintain its status .
We need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inc@@ lined towards the super@@ ficial .
Liter@@ ature likewise plays an important part in the way it tran@@ sm@@ its our cultural heritage , increases mutual famili@@ arity and preser@@ ves linguistic wealth and the diversity of ton@@ gues .
In this connection , I am very glad to say that soon after the S@@ oc@@ rates and Culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon , the country holding the presidency of the EU is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries .
I hope that this conference will also encourage the Commission to take the issue of libraries into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society .
Madam President , Commissioner , rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , somehow or other , today &apos; s agenda has come full circle .
We have had a great deal to say today about Europe as a community of values , about tolerance , human dignity , human rights , a positive approach to the enlargement process , transparency and respect for each other .
Youth , education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values , for giving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it credible in their eyes .
The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union &apos; s goals .
Cultural activity creates identity .
Cultural activity is an expression of individu@@ ality , of an individual &apos; s own personality ; it buil@@ ds relationships and communic@@ ates .
We want a colourful Europe .
We want a Europe based on the principle of diversity within unity .
We want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences .
That is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget , the allocation of funds that is , into the different types of measure .
That is why we opposed concentr@@ ating heavily on large networks and network structures , because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entities and activities performed by individuals ; because we want to see thousands of flowers blo@@ om .
I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say .
There is a contradiction in terms - unanimity principle , codecision procedure , and Conci@@ liation Committee - and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen , and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a European consciousness .
Madam President , as we have heard , all the groups have a common political enemy in the Council .
It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture &apos; s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure , for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture ho@@ stage to other interests .
In this way , the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a block@@ ading instrument of the first order .
The battle for a work@@ able compromise la@@ sted almost two years , and now , at long last , the European Parliament can give the go@@ -@@ ahead .
The Council could not be moved , not even when the prec@@ urs@@ or programmes Kal@@ ei@@ do@@ scope , Ari@@ ane and Rap@@ ha@@ el finished .
A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap .
This showed up the weaknesses of the European Union &apos; s cultural policy activities once again .
The political fight over funding and programme struc@@ turing is out of all proportion to the volume of support .
Out of 4@@ 10 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.@@ 07 million could be considered .
The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro !
And so the moderate sum of 16@@ 7 million will stand until 2004 .
That is the same as a single , medium-sized , German opera house &apos; s expenditure over the same period , when here in Europe this sum has been ear@@ marked for 29 countries over a period of five years !
There is a b@@ lat@@ ant discre@@ pan@@ cy here !
And so we are going to have to be content , albeit very gru@@ d@@ g@@ ingly , with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content .
Pre@@ vious speakers have already kin@@ dly pointed this out .
We can only hope that it will , after all , be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day .
Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good , not harm !
Cultural cooperation - and this was also mentioned earlier - truly creates identity , far more so than any transport directive , however important it might be .
Provi@@ ding support for culture meets with wide-@@ spread acceptance , and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions .
What , may I ask , is the Council afraid of ?
Madam President , wh@@ o@@ ever has the honour , like myself , to chair the Committee on Culture , cannot fail to agree with the comments from various Members and can but congratulate the rapporteur , and Commissioner Reding , with whom he worked and who , even during the conciliation process , had difficult moments and opposed the Council - you have heard this said by everyone .
I have noticed how the principle of a necessary culture at European organis@@ ational level has been firmly asser@@ ted , but there are few opportunities to address all the requests that the European States will make .
I shall simply stress my own personal complaint because , in the end , we did not manage to adopt a review clause .
However , Mrs Reding was certainly recep@@ tive and far@@ si@@ ghted , and personally under@@ took to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years , and therefore to change the situation .
This is not rhetoric , but the new em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of a modern liber@@ alism which un@@ ites the European States and constitutes a turning point for the European Parliament and the Commission .
Man and culture are priorities , and culture can result in economic growth .
Let us contem@@ plate this result , deri@@ ve satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embra@@ ce this worthwhile strategy .
Madam President , may I first thank Mr Gra@@ ça M@@ our@@ a for we@@ aving his way through the rather tough textiles and fi@@ bres that have made up this conciliation tap@@ est@@ ry .
It seems to me when entering the conciliation process for Culture 2000 , having a po@@ et to lead us in our endeav@@ ours is entirely appropriate .
Again , because these conci@@ li@@ ations are not entirely straight forward , we have to thank Vice-President Im@@ ben@@ i for his exemplary negotiating skills in the con@@ vol@@ uted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wis@@ ely deployed and given to us in our Community .
The fundamental question , it seems to me , that faces this Parliament , the Commission and the Council is : What is Europe ?
What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries ?
Europe is its people , its history and now its coll@@ ectiv@@ ity ; but the reason why Culture 2000 is so important to us is for this : I will w@@ ager that when we ask the question - &apos; What is Europe ? &apos; - we answer it by saying , &apos; It is our art , it is our literature and it is our heritage . &apos;
That is what Culture 2000 represents .
It represents the possibility of su@@ sta@@ ining a European identity in the twenty-@@ first century , an identity which es@@ che@@ ws the ech@@ oes of division , of war , of poverty , of opportunity , of poverty dans la re@@ alit@@ é .
And more than this - and this is more pro@@ sa@@ ic , Madam President , it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive , that are cross-@@ cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require .
It promotes mobility , and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded .
My only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we have now come to the end of a long road .
Following the conciliation stage , our institutions can now formally adopt the new &apos; Culture 2000 &apos; framework programme .
We shall thus , in the course of the next five years , have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear , well-@@ structured and , I am sure , successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector .
It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this &apos; happy ending &apos; in this House , and I thank you for it .
I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process .
I should like to express especi@@ al thanks to the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , particularly to its rapporteur , Mr Gra@@ ça M@@ our@@ a , its chairman , Mr Gar@@ gan@@ i , the European Parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups , the Conci@@ liation Committee and its chairman , Mr Im@@ ben@@ i .
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution .
Throughout the negotiations , they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally ti@@ res@@ ome negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time .
We now have a framework programme , the first of its type for the cultural sector , and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive , but also more thorough and detailed manner .
I would like to express my delight , with you , at this pleas@@ ing outcome . In spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions , these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gar@@ gan@@ i has just said , that the Commission made a statement regarding a mid-@@ term assessment .
It stated that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with Article 7 of the European Parliament and Council decision , it would carry out an assessment of the results of the programme , and this assessment will also cover the financial resources in the context of the Community financial perspectives .
If need be , the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision , and this should be achieved by 30 June 2002 .
Ladies and gentlemen , this is a formal commitment , not just words on paper .
All this must lead us to intensi@@ fy our action in favour of developing a common cultural area , within which our cultures can flour@@ ish further in all their unique features , in all their diversity , but may also be mutually enrich@@ ed and the other citizens of Europe may participate fully in them .
It is thanks , too , to Parliament &apos; s action , prefer@@ ring a number of small-@@ scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens &apos; cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale .
This is going to lead us to make &apos; Culture 2000 &apos; the programme of the citizen .
The increased participation of our citizens is something I hope and pra@@ y for .
I would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and I undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality .
I know that you , as Members of Parliament , in your own regions and countries , are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers , as one Member of Parliament said , go to make a vast mul@@ tic@@ ol@@ oured car@@ pet .
I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrich@@ ment for our citizens , both in personal as well as in social and economic terms , but a right which it is our job to asser@@ t , and also the hall@@ mark of re@@ discovered interaction within the Union .
This is what our European &apos; Culture 2000 &apos; programme offers .
It does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States . Such policies are necessary , and I would like to see them developed further .
It simply adds to them , compl@@ ements them , building a bridge between the various cultures of our various countries .
I feel therefore that extending and enrich@@ ing European citizens &apos; participation in culture is a crucial task , one which justi@@ fies the efforts we make to achieve it , and this is the y@@ ard@@ stick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our Union .
A number of Members of Parliament have quite rightly raised this point . If the Union is purely an economic union , then it is a still@@ born project .
However , if it is a union of culture , civilisation and participation , then it becomes a living thing .
This is the foundation , ladies and gentlemen , which I intend to develop , and I shall take the following five areas into special consideration : firstly , providing creative people with opportunities of an innovative nature to allow their talent to find the support it deserves in our programme .
Secondly , encouraging exchanges , mobility and training in the cultural sector .
Thirdly , promoting cooperation between cultural operators .
Fourthly , increasing audi@@ ences for culture , with particular emphasis on attrac@@ ting young people to culture and , fif@@ thly , protecting the common cultural heritage on the European scale as well as the history of the peoples of Europe , and making them better known .
The new programme will , I am sure , in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency , efficiency and balance , prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures .
Madam President , I reiterate my thanks to Parliament for its support and for , once again , having shown the importance it att@@ aches to culture in the context of the Union .
I am certain that it will not be disappointed , having given us its support , and I personally undertake to keep Parliament informed , as things progress , of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens , which I hope will be great measures for the future of the Union .
Thank you , Commissioner . I think we can also thank the rapporteur once again .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
( The sitting was closed at 9.@@ 55 p.m. )
En@@ d-@@ of-@@ life vehicles
Mr President , nine million cars are sh@@ red@@ ded and scra@@ pped every year in Europe .
Even though they can no longer be driven , these nine million cars may still be tra@@ ded and moved across borders ; and not just in@@ tra-@@ Community borders , but also those outside the Union .
It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recy@@ c@@ led and processed .
We believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground@@ -@@ breaking .
We therefore have a number of amendments .
I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective .
I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive .
Nor do I think that motor@@ cycles should be included , as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motor@@ cycle industry ob@@ vi@@ ates the need for a European directive in this area .
I am not looking for such rigi@@ dly high recycling quotas when it comes to speci@@ al-@@ purpose vehicles either .
I want speci@@ al-@@ purpose vehicles such as am@@ bul@@ ances to have high recovery quotas .
This is my main concern in this matter .
In my opinion , the directive soli@@ dly regul@@ ates the matter of accountability for how a car is dis@@ posed of in Europe .
This can be left as the Commission has proposed with the Member States ensuring the appropriate collection points for dra@@ ining cars .
This will involve , for example , dispos@@ ing of more than 32 million lots of used oil , removing break flu@@ id , etc .
An important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts .
What should we do with the sh@@ red@@ ded products ?
We should not over@@ look the fact that , although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery , they are by no means the only point .
Do not forget that , in the case of cars , 80 % of environmental impact comes through driving , 1 % through recovery and 19 % through construction .
Quot@@ as are not , therefore , the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility , just one of many .
Of course we need to aim high , but quotas must not become an end in themselves .
We must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars .
I am far ke@@ ener to see us move away from today &apos;s car , weigh@@ ing 1,@@ 400 kg and driving an average of 200@@ ,000 km , to a future car capable of driving the same distance but weigh@@ ing just 1,000 kg .
This would at least mean 400 kg times 200@@ ,000 km less transportation .
This would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which , if I have rightly understood the Kyoto Protocol , is the important factor .
We therefore consider that , in future , vehicles which clearly and effectively use light@@ weight construction methods will produce less CO2 and should receive prefer@@ ential treatment in their comb@@ us@@ tion quotas .
It should not be for each Member State , but for you and your staff , Commissioner , to decide whether these light@@ weight construction vehicles ( and there is also talk of 3-@@ li@@ tre vehicles ) should receive prefer@@ ential treatment .
We think they should .
May I say something about costs .
Some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers ; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer .
However , this can be seriously ques@@ tioned as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consumers and acquire for themselves a state-@@ sanc@@ tioned monopoly on recycling .
I can only war@@ n you against cons@@ enting to this .
There are amendments which propose split@@ ting the costs fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ fif@@ ty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car .
The money from this pool , system , or however you want to picture it , would mean that from 2006 all vehicles in circulation could be taken in without cost to the last holder .
This too is a particular desire of my group .
Our proposal to split the costs has a crucial advantage , namely that we won &apos;t be an immediate candidate for the Court of Justice when the directive is adopted .
The car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions , which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly .
This is why I propose split@@ ting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer .
As for a ban on certain materials : of course we need one !
A car has dangerous components which we must ban long-term .
This means that we need a pressure instrument .
The Commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives .
There are a number of sound amendments .
This Parliament has been given more authority , so let us use it !
Let us have the courage to put together a ground@@ -@@ breaking directive .
A directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this House .
I ask for your support .
Mr President , I almost feel like saying , &quot; P@@ he@@ w &quot; , now that we have at last come to the second reading on this directive which has given us so much work , and which has clearly also given a great deal of work to the rapporteur , Mr Florenz .
I do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been abandoned and which , today , can only be removed at local authority expense , i.e. the taxpayers &apos; expense .
The principle of &apos; poll@@ uter pays &apos; is not being applied .
V@@ eh@@ ic@@ les already abandoned have also been abandoned by Community legislation , in that they are not taken into consideration either in the texts on emissions or in this text on end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles .
The only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future .
It has not , however , been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recy@@ cle .
On the other hand , we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find ( a ) materials that are easier to recy@@ cle and ( b ) to set up recycling industries .
I should also like to stress the need to maintain a flexible approach to recycling , re@@ use and inc@@ iner@@ ation , as far as the new particularly light materials are concerned which make it possible to reduce vehicle consumption and therefore emissions .
This is a problem of compatibility between our directives on end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles and the former directives , including the one on au@@ to-@@ oil , which we voted on a few years ago .
We must therefore congratulate the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on having the wisdom , in order to make things perfectly clear , to re@@ introduce the clause making an exception of the vin@@ tage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage .
In conclusion , let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypo@@ critical with regard to the fate reserved for the w@@ re@@ cks which still cl@@ utter our forests , lakes and gardens .
Once again , the principle of &apos; poll@@ uter pays &apos; is not being applied . The taxpay@@ er is still footing the bill .
Mr President , Commissioner , reading the le@@ af@@ lets which have been distributed in recent weeks , one would think that we were talking about the ultimate environmental catastro@@ phe or the death of the car industry in Europe .
Neither is correct .
We simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive .
It means ecological progress for Europe , and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in en@@ acting it and setting it in motion .
All the same , there is one point on which we are in conflict .
In the grand scheme of the directive , it is perhaps a minor point , but nevertheless a disp@@ uted one .
It concerns the issue of recycling costs .
Here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year &apos;s debate in the Council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were l@@ ump@@ ed together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs .
Last February in this House we un@@ ambigu@@ ously decided ( and we Social Democrats are sti@@ cking to this ) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question !
So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be dis@@ posed of ?
For us this is straightforward : in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also comp@@ el manufacturers to design and build recy@@ cl@@ able cars .
And what about vehicles which are already on the road ?
Let us look at an example . R@@ over in Great Britain , if they were responsible for all end-@@ of-@@ life cars , would actually be responsible for 5.@@ 8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs , whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out pe@@ an@@ uts , as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it .
Such distor@@ tions in competition are not about environmental protection ; they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in Europe .
Consequently , for end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs .
I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full wh@@ ack and that they are not interested in the problem of distor@@ tions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds .
However , I would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from building cars in Europe , so that these jobs can be secured in the future .
I am in favour of stringent environmental requirements , as you know from the au@@ to-@@ oil programme and the debate on exhau@@ st emissions , but I believe that they should be the same for everyone !
Mr President , Commissioner , I think we need this directive .
Firstly , because it clearly stipul@@ ates the environmental objectives .
Secondly , because it can promote recycling , which is important .
Thirdly , because it sets out a clear procedure to combat pollution caused by heavy metals .
This is also an important point .
The directive affor@@ ds a European framework , also to Member States who already have systems in place and who wish to continue to use these .
So , first of all , we need to keep the recycling percent@@ ages at their present level . This will , of course , provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dis@@ pose of .
Secondly , we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position .
As from 2006 , therefore , all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners .
Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way .
Is this too much of a burden ? There is , however , one thing we should not over@@ look .
The directive applies to complete cars , that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing . According to the experts , few of these complete cars are of no value .
After all , recycling and the re-@@ use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily los@@ s-@@ making .
Quite the reverse , in fact . At present , there is a whole raft of companies which make a living out of them , and a decent one at that .
This directive encourages the whole of this sector . It is a sector which comprises small and medium-sized businesses .
Since , in this case , transport costs are high , a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentr@@ alised , because transpor@@ ting an end-@@ of-@@ life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km is not a profitable activity .
I think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles , and I think we ought to add this provision to it .
I think , therefore , that vin@@ tage cars ought to be exemp@@ t .
Also , it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer . That is a basic principle which we must uphold .
As manufacturers are responsible for the design , they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase .
We must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer , as stipul@@ ated in the common position .
I find this a well-@@ balanced formula which does not prec@@ lu@@ de a number of other things .
I think we need to retain it .
This is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence .
After all , we are all aware how difficult it was within the Council to bring this common position about , and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position .
In my opinion , we should not jeopardi@@ se that common position , because it is a directive which we desper@@ ately need for environmental reasons .
I would ask you to support this common position .
Our group will , at any rate , do this as far as possible - for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well-@@ balanced and encomp@@ asses a whole range of issues and difficulties including , for example , the way in which the costs are to be distributed .
Mr President , we need to take an important decision today .
Does this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer &apos; s liability , that is to say that cars , once they have reached the end of their lives , are the responsibility of the car manufacturer ?
No , according to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No. 38 : car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50 / 50 .
It is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50 / 50 compromise is included that this does not work .
Pack@@ aging still accounts for a mountain of rub@@ b@@ ish in Europe and is a burden upon the environment .
Some of the soci@@ alists under the direction of Mr Bern@@ d Lange say : yes , we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45 .
The common position stipul@@ ates 2006 . According to the group of the Greens , this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations .
I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the soci@@ alists .
If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars , they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-@@ used more easily and more che@@ ap@@ ly .
The problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant@@ -based bi@@ op@@ las@@ tic . This is ultimately cheaper , also for the consumer .
For twenty years , the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy gre@@ ener .
Today , this green position is being threatened under pressure from , in particular , the German and French car industries .
That is why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45 .
We , the Green Group , by and large support the common position .
Mr President , the waste from end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances .
We in the Con@@ federal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is human@@ ly possible in this area .
With this directive , we have the chance to take a big step forward , but this pres@@ up@@ poses that the Council &apos; s position is not tor@@ n to sh@@ reds and weak@@ ened in Parliament &apos; s reading of it .
If they were adopted , many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive .
This applies , above all , to amendments from the Group of the European People &apos; s Party but also , unfortunately , to some of the amendments from Mr Lange , as I see it .
It is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries , for example in Germany , went in for some pretty tough lob@@ b@@ ying before the present directive was adopted .
For ourselves , it is crucial that the following principles should apply .
The poll@@ uter should pay .
This means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility , financial as well as otherwise , for recycling vehicles .
There must be rules governing existing vehicles too .
Where this aspect is concerned , we cannot accept any weak@@ ening of the Council &apos; s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force .
There should be no fall@@ ing-@@ off in the percent@@ ages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years , and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead .
We shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations .
If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive , this would be very detri@@ mental , not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament &apos; s credibility on environmental issues .
Refer@@ ence was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries , for example my own country , Sweden .
I was myself a car worker before I was elected . I believe I am one of the few members of this Parliament to have stood beside a production line and assemb@@ led cars .
I think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry . These would , of course , be to the advantage of modern , progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms .
It is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the European Union .
Mr President , I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament , as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe .
There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment .
Our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests .
Each year , there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scra@@ pped within the European Union .
This in itself generates a large amount of waste .
Car manufacturers , the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recy@@ c@@ led materials can be used in the manufacture of cars .
We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and b@@ read@@ th of the European Union .
From an Irish perspective , I know that the Irish Department of the Environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in Ireland in the near future to deal with end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles .
I see no reason why licensing arrangements cannot be organised across Europe for collection centres to scra@@ p the 8 to 9 million vehicles which are dis@@ posed of within the European Union on an annual basis .
Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-@@ use , recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years .
In accordance with new provisions included in the Amsterdam Treaty all the 3@@ 70 million consumers within the European Union have a right to consu@@ mer@@ -@@ related information .
I believe EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environment@@ ally-@@ friendly practices in the coming year .
My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vin@@ tage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations .
Mr President , the directive on end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles is certainly a mil@@ estone in the improvement of the environment in Europe .
I also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials , a reduction of poll@@ uting waste and the promotion of technological innovation .
In this regard , we are certainly on the right track , but as some Members have already stressed , the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers &apos; responsibility will become a shared responsibility .
I would like to say that in Italy , considerable head@@ way has been made in this sector ; we are perhaps the first in Europe to have regulations encouraging us to take end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles off the market , but in our country the average age of cars on the road is rather high , and we therefore have serious concerns over the problems that this directive could ent@@ ail for the market .
We need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter .
In Italy , we have begun to withdraw and recy@@ cle around 80 % of old cars , but there is a market problem which could trigger a crisis - in terms of unemployment given that in Italy industry often resorts to la@@ y-@@ off@@ s and redund@@ ancies - and cause problems for workers in different parts of Italy .
We must therefore try to re@@ conci@@ le the two requirements - Parliament is sometimes a little extrem@@ ist , adopting positions that are either extremely pro-@@ green or extremely anti-@@ green - and , all things considered , find a way to combine the effort made by Mr Florenz and that of other Members , who are trying to re@@ conci@@ le the two positions as best as possible .
These worthwhile amendments are the outcome of this ; I think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem , that is , to re@@ conci@@ le environmental requirements with market and labour requirements .
Mr President , this directive deals with the compar@@ atively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life .
To that extent , it might be thought desirable , even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity .
The key questions now are who pays the EUR 26@@ 2 per car for the 9 million cars that are dis@@ posed of each year ?
Who pays for the collection , the dismant@@ ling , the disposal and so on ?
And should the directive be retro@@ spective to cover every car that has ever been made ?
The proposal from the Council , the common position , is that manufacturers should pay the lot .
That would mean billions of po@@ unds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the European Union .
That cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the bu@@ yers of new cars .
Because European car manufac@@ tures have been operating here for many , many more decades than companies from Japan , Korea and elsewhere , that would be a much greater burden on the older European companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere .
I commend Mr Florenz , Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs .
I also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleagues from Germany , Italy , Ireland , Spain , Sweden and Britain , to remove the retro@@ spective nature of this measure .
Ret@@ ro@@ spective law is bad law , it is unfair law and often it is un@@ work@@ able law .
Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest , which clearly there is not in this case .
That is why I have called for a roll@@ -@@ call vote on this .
We can see who is prepared to vote for a retro@@ sp@@ ection which is of doub@@ t@@ ful leg@@ ality , which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry .
Mr President , once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive , and reaffir@@ m my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague , Bern@@ d Lange . These amendments actually have the advantage - and I should like to stress this - of re@@ conc@@ iling environmental constraints and economic imper@@ atives .
The Council &apos; s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all , or a significant part , of the costs of recovery and recycling .
But , as Mr Lange so rightly said , this solution is totally unfair to European car manufacturers .
Com@@ ing from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry , I can tell you that it is not possible , retro@@ actively , to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road , i.e. effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80 % of the total number of cars in Europe .
This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs .
The common position puts European car manufacturers in a dis@@ advan@@ tage@@ ous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the European market .
Of course , we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby . We are here to build a Europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive .
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposed directive on end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles before us today aims firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union , but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector .
Let me briefly say that historic and vin@@ tage vehicles must , of course , be exemp@@ t from the scope of this directive . Car@@ s are also part of our cultural heritage .
I think we would all agree on that . Having said that , one of the st@@ um@@ bling blocks concerns Article 12 , i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force .
Parliament &apos; s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive &apos; s entry into force , for new vehicles , is not terri@@ bly realistic .
The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recover@@ ed even though they were not designed for recycling .
The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road .
This would , furthermore , make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses .
Like my group , I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which , I feel , offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection .
Mr President , the European Parliament is today facing an important decision .
Will we give our backing to forwar@@ d-@@ looking environmental and consumer protection or , as the amendments of Florenz , Lange and others cause me to fear , will we allow ourselves to become a serv@@ ant of the German car industry ?
The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake .
It would be sham@@ eful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the profes@@ sions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection !
The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious : to sab@@ ot@@ age the directive !
The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the poll@@ uter pays principle and det@@ ra@@ ct from product innovation .
In setting up numerous hur@@ d@@ les their sole aim is to h@@ amp@@ er an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type appro@@ vals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more .
This is totally unacceptable .
I therefore appeal to the German deleg@@ ates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today !
The re@@ d-@@ green federal government has not exactly covered itself with gl@@ ory in the debate on the En@@ d-@@ of-@@ life V@@ eh@@ ic@@ les Directive .
Do not continue in this v@@ ein !
The wh@@ ing@@ ing about competitive dis@@ advantages is lau@@ gh@@ able if it only concerns competitive dis@@ advantages sustained by the German car industry .
Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers !
Vo@@ te in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry !
Mr President , this directive has been under discussion since 1997 .
It is high time that we reached an agreement .
Since I more or less share the views of my colleague , Mr S@@ j@@ öst@@ edt and the representative of the Greens , Mr de Ro@@ o , I am not going to use the two minutes all@@ ot@@ ted to me , and I will highlight just two issues .
Firstly , and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal , the idea , which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste , that we should use materials which will subsequently cause less pollution .
Another point is that waste should not be inc@@ iner@@ ated or crus@@ hed , not only in the case of lead , cad@@ mium and mer@@ cury , but also in the case of waste which contains PVC .
Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context .
The other question is who should bear the cost .
I agree with previous speakers who have said that the poll@@ uter should pay , and this proposal expresses that idea very well .
Produc@@ ers must pay - although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequences of this - and they must take responsibility for the costs before 2006 , as some of the amendments propose .
We are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading .
It is also important to set percent@@ ages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recy@@ cl@@ able materials .
I believe that this proposal rel@@ ies on very long deadlines .
Lastly , Mr President , I believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized businesses which , if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised , can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area , preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies .
Mr President , today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibilities . We have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year .
In some of our Member States , voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our di@@ t@@ ches , can@@ als and fields are not filled with these ug@@ ly and dangerous w@@ re@@ cks , inhab@@ ited occasionally by an al@@ armed far@@ my@@ ard ch@@ icken .
I come , of course , from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in Europe and in third countries .
I can gau@@ ge its importance for my country &apos; s international reputation .
I know of the pro@@ active attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismant@@ ling end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles .
I am aware of the difficulties the Council experienced in finding a compromise .
That is why , today , we must be understanding al@@ chem@@ ists , concerned for our environment . This will either be the century of waste management or it will not .
As far as I am concerned , at least , the principle of &apos; poll@@ uter pays &apos; must be applied .
The car industry , increasingly more resp@@ ect@@ ful of the environment , has , I am sure , anticipated this kind of increasing awareness .
Indeed it is accepting its responsibilities .
It is the Member States , however , who will have to implement this directive , and let us bew@@ are of going into too much detail because the industrial traditions , the demo@@ li@@ tion and crus@@ hing sectors vary according to whether you are in Italy or in Finland .
I am opposed to making the car owners liable .
The men and women on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their cat@@ aly@@ tic conver@@ ter , pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement .
It would certainly be un@@ wise for my fellow Members in the major groups of the feder@@ alist tendency to seek to make the European Parliament un@@ popular in this way by creating a liability shared between the owner and the manufacturer .
How , furthermore , can a fund be created which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operations within Europe .
Who is to pay for recycling the car I bought in France if I register it in Belgium ?
Which national fund will pay for my end-@@ of-@@ life vehicle ?
Let us bew@@ are , too , of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retro@@ active application .
It is not our intention to start a p@@ uni@@ tive legislative campaign here today , but to continue on our present course , advoc@@ ating sustainable development .
Mr President , most of the time , the European Parliament , sp@@ ear@@ headed by environment committees , does its very best to make a critical assessment of the proposals submitted by the European Commission or the Council , so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view .
Now , a sound common position submitted by the Council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in Parliament .
Every year , we disc@@ ard a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances .
This is why it is important to prevent waste materials .
We should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals , as well as of other dangerous substances and materials .
In addition , car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismant@@ ling and re-@@ use .
What is left of the stri@@ pped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately .
I therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for re-@@ use and recycling which have been proposed by the Council .
These days , the complete dismant@@ ling of end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles is economically viable . This means that we move away from sh@@ red@@ ding .
The prescri@@ bed objectives are most certainly viable and , in the Netherlands , a value of 86 % recycling has now already been achieved .
The best way of achieving proper collection is to ensure that the last holder and / or owner can deliver the car to an authorised treatment facility without any cost .
The processing cost can then be incorporated in the price of new cars .
The proposals made by a few MEPs impact greatly on this system .
The so-called shared liability is very cum@@ ber@@ some and does not stimulate innovation .
If the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied , it will also transp@@ ire that the cost of processing will come down considerably .
Finally , this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity .
A lab@@ orious conciliation procedure would ent@@ ail an unnecessary delay , at the expense of the environment .
Why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled ?
If we are , then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the Council on the result achieved .
Mr President , I hold Mr Florenz in high est@@ e@@ em .
He has delivered excellent work under pressure both from his colleagues and from the car industry .
Add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and , against that background , find a compromise . That was not easy .
Overall , I am not dis@@ satisfied with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlying that common position . I would like to comment on two things .
These should indeed be excluded from the directive . Secondly , the controversial question as to who bears the responsibility for taking back cars .
I do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way .
The manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and / or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost .
In my opinion , there is too much initial hes@@ itation .
The car lobby has led too many people up the garden path .
I would also like to mention that experience has nonetheless taught us that the processing cost is in fact passed on .
These costs are not very high .
In the Member State where I come from , you are talking about 150 Gu@@ il@@ ders per car .
If you charge this from day one , you can process the old cars straight away .
A very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that sc@@ rap@@ yards , which used to be a common feature in our Member States , would then disappear .
I do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise .
I think it would be a good thing if we were to approve the present legislation together as soon as possible .
This is positive because , in that way , the nine million cars which are introduced each year onto European roads will actually be processed appropriately , and this will benefit us all .
Mr President , the present directive is important in so far as it helps prevent our being faced with hazardous waste from end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles and in so far as it promotes the re-@@ use and recycling of materials from scra@@ pped cars .
I therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers &apos; liability .
If we do reduce it , we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste .
The common position , which was arrived at with great difficulty in the Council , which the Commission has endorsed and which was also maintained in Parliament &apos; s Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , comp@@ lies fully with the environmental requirements .
I therefore find it in@@ comprehensible and very cur@@ ious to see amendments from members of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , the objectives of which are to weaken the environmental requirements and significantly reduce car manufacturers &apos; liability .
If these amendments are adopted , I think that we shall cause Parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues .
So far , we here in Parliament have been positive cat@@ alyst@@ s for environmental protection but now , if the amendments proposed by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange are adopted , we are to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe .
What is more , if we reduce manufacturers &apos; liability on this issue , this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas , for example the forthcoming directive on scra@@ p from computers and other electronic equipment .
I would therefore recommend to Members of Parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers &apos; liability .
We shall then be able to achieve an environmentally resp@@ ec@@ table result .
Mr President , this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars , encourage recycling , and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recy@@ c@@ led .
Now who should pay the costs ?
Whatever system is adopted , ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer .
The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for dispos@@ ing and recycling of the cars .
The manufacturers have tri@@ cked Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into tab@@ ling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals .
Do not be fo@@ ol@@ ed by the car manufacturers !
If you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments .
Mr President , Commissioner , this debate is not a technical debate , contrary to what we may think .
It has become emin@@ ently political .
Yesterday we hon@@ oured our institution with a political debate .
Today , if 3@@ 14 Members of Parliament yield to the strength of the lob@@ b@@ ying of some car manufacturers , we should be doing ourselves dish@@ on@@ our .
In expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles , as Amendment No 38 stipul@@ ates , even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer , Parliament would , for the first time , not be acting as the def@@ ender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of Europe , it would be turning into mere sound@@ ing box for different lob@@ bi@@ es .
We cannot accept this . It would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas .
It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weak@@ ening a Council position , whereas usually we are compl@@ aining that their position is not strong enough .
The free recovery system , for example , for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recy@@ c@@ led will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly .
Thus , for the consumer , for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling , the Council &apos; s common position definitely must not be amended . It is , as it stands , perfectly acceptable .
Mr President , like so many others here today , I believe this is a good measure .
This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need .
Most of the technical issues have been resolved .
There are some details to be fin@@ alised but most of the technical issues have been resolved .
We have arrived at the final question .
In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the dra@@ ftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament .
That is quite simply : Who pays ?
The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost , not all of it as Mr Bo@@ wis has mist@@ ak@@ en@@ ly said .
In fact perhaps as little , the lawyers tell us , as 20 % or one-@@ fifth of the cost .
That is not un@@ reasonable .
If you look at the UK consumer for example , who bu@@ ys a R@@ over , as Mr Lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars , over and above comparable prices in other parts of Europe , why should they pay ?
They have paid already .
Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car bu@@ yers , pay again to dis@@ pose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from ?
I cannot accept that .
There are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case .
I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it .
The responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer .
It is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal .
The common position does not prec@@ lu@@ de the possibility of contributions being made by government .
The common position is a reasonable compromise .
Some of the amendments today are totally un@@ reasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road .
I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments .
Mr President , there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will properly deal with end-@@ of-@@ life cars , although in this instance the Council has not provided a model for a suitable European environment policy .
It is dis@@ gra@@ ceful the way in which the German Presidency handled this matter .
Firstly , Herr T@@ rit@@ tin , the Environment Minister , was not in tune with his colleagues in the Cab@@ inet , then Chancellor Schrö@@ der bl@@ under@@ ed in like a bul@@ l in a ch@@ ina shop , having no expert knowledge of this process .
M@@ ind you , even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best result that could have been done achieved .
There are certain weaknesses , the greatest of which , in my opinion , is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses ; after all , the car industry is more than just large companies .
It is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium-sized enterprises .
For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector .
The p@@ light of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs .
The common position is also no great sha@@ kes from an environmental view@@ point .
It fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow deleg@@ ate from the Greens says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has t@@ oned down a common position , I really must object , because quite simply , it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern , low-@@ consumption cars such as the 3-@@ li@@ tre car , which contain a great deal of plastic , by means of rigid , high recycling quotas !
Consequently , we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars .
The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation .
However , the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persu@@ asi@@ ve if a commitment were to be given to reducing CO2 levels in Europe in other sectors besides these .
Mr President , we are indeed now in a very rare situation : those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the Council in their common position .
In contrast to what the previous speaker said , I can say I am really proud that a common position was achieved during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental values .
If we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs , we will be creating a lo@@ op@@ hole : we will not have created a rational , clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order .
That is why , in my opinion , the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility .
Only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem , taking into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encouraged to make vehicles whose parts can be recy@@ c@@ led at the smallest possible cost in the future .
Mr President , there are two issues of principle in the Council &apos; s draft directive .
The first concerns the manufacturer &apos; s un@@ restricted liability to take back end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles .
There is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismant@@ ling trade . This particularly applies in areas within the EU where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismant@@ ling vehicles .
I believe that , quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned , the EU &apos; s directives should not treat small companies within the Union un@@ fairly .
Un@@ restricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts dis@@ appears , for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts .
Yet the trade in used car parts is important , especially for those who collect and renov@@ ate older vehicles .
The principle of un@@ restricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also du@@ bi@@ ous in terms of the principles governing the market economy .
It should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wo@@ und up .
They should be able to establish themselves in new markets , but also to leave old markets .
To b@@ ind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill acc@@ ords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development .
The second principle in the Council &apos; s common position is the retro@@ active element in the draft directive .
It conflicts with established economic and legal principles retro@@ actively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product .
To do so also changes the owner &apos; s liability retro@@ actively . Over the years , a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways .
Every country within the EU now has rules governing the scra@@ pping of cars .
Some may be better than others , and some worse .
In anticip@@ ation of this EU directive &apos; s being implemented , EU countries ought however to be individually liable for scra@@ pping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retro@@ active element in the EU legislation is not applied .
This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds .
Mr President , everyone agrees with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question .
The common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and prec@@ arious nature somewhat restric@@ ts the opportunities for improvement , and puts the whole directive at risk .
I therefore maintain that Parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradox@@ ical for it to do so in the context of re@@ defining the environmental scope of the instrument .
I would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive ; the costs are not excessive : recycling a car costs less than 1 % of the price of a new car .
Mr President , this is an extremely bad directive .
First of all , as my colleague Mr Bo@@ wis has pointed out , it is retro@@ spective and that is wrong in principle .
Secondly , it dump@@ s huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment .
In this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment .
I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect , which has not been examined well enough in this debate .
It is like so much European legislation .
It is far too prescri@@ p@@ tive .
It sets in stone one particular model of recycling .
The production line was invented about a hundred years ago , I believe , by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nin@@ ete@@ en@@ th century production line in reverse - to dismant@@ le vehicles , to take the pieces apart and seek to recy@@ cle them .
One thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recy@@ c@@ led plastic b@@ ump@@ ers of cars .
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so .
There is already a very successful industry out there which is sh@@ red@@ ding cars , recover@@ ing metals and recover@@ ing energy by the inc@@ iner@@ ation of the non-@@ metal@@ lic parts .
This is a very environmentally reasonable approach .
It is just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery .
This method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the &quot; dead &quot; car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and rec@@ lam@@ ation process .
I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescri@@ p@@ tive , it ign@@ ores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally , and are certainly very damaging economically .
Mr President , the common position is sound , but it is up to Parliament to improve the common position on end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles .
The Soci@@ al-@@ Democratic Group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days .
I would especially draw your attention to Amendment No 45 , in which a choice is made in favour of laying the cost of dis@@ assembly and recycling at the door of the manufacturer , for new cars at any rate . Consequently , consideration will also be given to recycling during the conception phase and production .
For the cars currently on the road , it would be reasonable to share the cost , for example by setting up a fund such as that in the Netherlands .
The common position stipul@@ ates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost , they should also take back end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles .
This is a big problem in my opinion .
I urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismant@@ ling and recycling of vehicles , as they would gain an excessive hold over the second-@@ hand components market .
They would then determine their own prices .
Anyone who has been in an old car knows that this is to the detriment of the consumer and the am@@ ateur mechan@@ ic .
The European consumer organisation , which has asked us to support the common position on this point , is to my mind letting the consumer down .
A second argument for keeping the dismant@@ ling of cars out of the manufacturers &apos; cl@@ ut@@ ches is the cost of transport .
If car manufacturers all set up their own dismant@@ ling companies , this will necessi@@ t@@ ate transpor@@ ting end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles over long distances .
This is environmentally un@@ friendly but also expensive and does not benefit the consumer either .
I would therefore appreciate your support for Amendment No 45 .
Mr President , Commissioner , I have asked to speak again so that I can say a few more words at the close of this debate .
If you travel to the Netherlands , you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost-@@ free .
You will also find that these cars are su@@ itably dis@@ posed of , that new material flows have been opened up in order to recy@@ cle materials , that 85 % of the weight of a car is recy@@ c@@ led and that 92 % of all cars in the Netherlands are recy@@ c@@ led .
This is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes .
Should this be condemned ec@@ ologically , Frau Bre@@ yer ?
I do not think so .
The Netherlands has an exemplary model for dispos@@ ing of cars as per the wishes of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or , in the case of end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles currently driving around , the manufacturer , has nothing , absolutely nothing , to do with ec@@ ology ; it is a simple question of competition !
( Applause from the PSE Group )
Mr President , the proposal we are discussing has a huge amount of advantages , mainly in the interests of preventing waste and encouraging re-@@ use , the recovery and recycling of components and the recovery of materials , etc .
I think we have tabled a sound proposal .
The main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer , the vend@@ or , or wh@@ o@@ ever , should take the end-@@ of-@@ life vehicle back without any cost .
I will only give the example of my own country to illustr@@ ate how this system functions there without any problems .
We have reached an agreement with all the parties involved . These include car manufacturers , second-@@ hand car dealers , the federation of the car industry , the metal processing firms , sh@@ red@@ ding firms and the government .
An environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis .
The car industry - and Belgium produces a great many car@@ s- did not have any problem with that .
Belgi@@ ans can deliver their cars back to the vend@@ or without any cost .
In connection with this , we have noticed how - quite contrary to what has been said here to the effect that the scheme would be to the detriment of employment - a number of small businesses have taken the recycling of materials to heart and are doing very well .
Some businesses have become hi@@ -@@ tech businesses , because they managed to recy@@ cle certain materials , even materials which are not yet included in the directive .
So this means that we are developing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a huge favour into the bar@@ gain .
I am in favour of collection free of charge .
It worked for us .
Why would it not work elsewhere ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for an interesting debate in which many important arguments have been presented .
Would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes .
Allow me briefly to comment on some of the assu@@ mp@@ tions and principles behind the present directive .
Allow me also to begin by comm@@ enting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate .
First of all , I think I should repeat some of the basic facts which Mr Florenz and others have already mentioned .
What we are discussing here is the fact that close on ten million cars are scra@@ pped every year in the European Union , resulting in approximately as many millions of tons of waste .
This means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars , and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open .
Moreover , they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind .
Ap@@ proxim@@ ately ten per cent of lead production is to be found in cars , but also cad@@ mium , ch@@ ro@@ mium , mer@@ cury and other very dangerous substances .
This is something you already know , but I would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who are listening .
Car@@ s are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in Europe .
We know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it , and there is no excuse for not taking action .
The present directive has three aims .
First of all , we want to stop heavy metals from being used in the manufacture of new cars .
Secondly , we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable .
We can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product &apos; s life-@@ cycle . Instead , we should avoid creating so much waste .
We should see to it that we recy@@ cle as much as possible of the various contents of a product .
Thirdly , we wish to achieve the recycling objectives specified in the present directive .
These are the three most important aims of the directive .
This is , of course , because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recy@@ c@@ led .
It is , above all , the manufacturer &apos; s resources we are wast@@ ing if we do not get to gri@@ ps with a car &apos; s life-@@ cycle .
Two important questions have ar@@ isen in this regard . Yes , there are in fact more than two questions , but I want to mention just two of the most important .
First of all : who should pay ?
And secondly : are we reducing the European car industry &apos; s competitiveness by means of the present proposal ?
The first question , then , is about who should pay .
The directive states that the poll@@ uter should pay and that the cost is to be borne mainly by the manufacturer in accordance with the principles to be found in the EU &apos; s treaty concerning the manufacturer &apos; s liability .
It is nonetheless clear that the cost will be borne jointly by manufacturers and consumers .
We have calculated that the cost of recycling cars does not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car .
Do we imagine , then , that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive ? No .
Clearly , we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment , but it will be very much greater .
Moreover , the cost will have to be borne in the future .
The cost will not therefore disappear , but now we are clari@@ fying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed .
Are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis ?
Is it an un@@ profitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it ?
Is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these ?
Is it the case that the mo@@ tives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the European car industry ?
No , of course not .
It is quite the opposite . Do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly cars and more fu@@ el-@@ efficient cars is going to decline in the future ?
What kind of requirements do you think our children and grand@@ children and future legislat@@ ors are going to make of cars ?
Naturally , that they should be environmentally friendly , that they should be recy@@ cl@@ able , that they should be fu@@ el-@@ efficient and that they should not poll@@ ute our environment .
It is , of course , only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry .
We must create forms of mo@@ tive power which are not damaging to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste , recy@@ cle materials and compete by means of environmentally friendly and fu@@ el-@@ efficient cars .
The fact that we have a European car industry which has already made great stri@@ des more than properly compens@@ ates for the fact that there are , in fact , a good many cars on European roads for which they must take responsibility .
The cost is not ins@@ ur@@ moun@@ table ; nor is the task an impossible one .
If we develop mo@@ tive power of the kind I have described , I am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the work@@ load . These will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scra@@ pping and recycling systems .
The industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in Europe .
They will not represent an ins@@ ur@@ moun@@ table cost for the European car industry .
They will instead help industry to be in the van@@ guard of eventually producing environmentally friendly and more fu@@ el-@@ efficient cars .
We must do this for the sake of the environment .
The costs will not disappear . Nor will the waste disappear .
But , otherwise , we must all of us , as taxpayers or citizens , foot the bill . What is more , the costs will be higher the longer we wait before taking action .
That is what I should like to say by way of introduction .
I also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retro@@ active legislation .
If we assume that , on average , a car has a life of el@@ even years , do Members , indeed does anyone , believe that we should wait for el@@ even years before we get to gri@@ ps with this problem ?
Do you think that , when we legisl@@ ate about chemicals , we should say that we are ign@@ oring those chemicals which are already on the market and that we are legisl@@ ating only for what is to be produced in the future ?
Clearly , we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars . It is still not an ins@@ ur@@ moun@@ table problem .
We can deal with it .
We already have an infrastructure . We have what we require in order to deal with end-@@ of-@@ life cars .
I naturally hope that the result of today &apos; s vote will be a good one .
If I have not already done so , I would also thank Mr Kar@@ l-@@ Hein@@ z Florenz for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy . In fact , it is in many respects pione@@ ering work when it comes to re-@@ use and manufacturer &apos; s liability .
I believe it will have very positive and notic@@ eable effects on the environment .
We cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters . As I have said , we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues .
After the first reading in the European Parliament in 1999 , the Commission &apos; s proposal ended up in an aw@@ k@@ ward political situation in the Council .
However , we obtained a well-@@ balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency .
Now , we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully .
A total of 48 amendments have been tabled .
The Commission can adopt 10 amendments in their enti@@ re@@ ty .
Three amendments can be partially approved , and one can be approved in principle . Cer@@ tain amendments concern improvements to the Commission &apos; s proposal which we adopted as early as at the first reading or else they re@@ introduce into the directive such parts of the original proposal as the Council has removed .
This applies to Amendment No 5 , excluding section 1 ; 8 and 9 , section 1 ; 10 and 12 , section 3 ; 15 , 16 , 20 , 22 , 24 and 25 . These amendments can all be approved .
Amendments Nos 6 and 21 are new ; the Commission can approve these .
The Commission can also approve Amendment No 26 with certain edi@@ torial changes .
I want to emphasise that a number of the other amendments affecting the proposal &apos; s basic components involve a considerable water@@ ing-@@ down of the level of environmental protection aimed at by the common position . They cannot therefore be approved .
Parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in Europe . It would am@@ a@@ ze and de@@ press me if it were not to do so today .
I am very concerned about certain amendments from Parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question .
These concern , for example , the phas@@ ing-@@ out of heavy metals , manufacturer &apos; s liability and the requirement for recycling .
I want to deal with these amendments on a group@@ -@@ by-@@ group basis .
Amendments Nos 4 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 28 , 30 , 32 , 37 , 42 and 48 concern the phas@@ ing-@@ out of heavy metals .
Amendment No 12 involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force .
Amendments Nos 13 , 28 , 32 , 37 , 42 and 48 involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions . This would mean that the process of replacing dangerous substances would be implemented more slowly .
Amendments Nos 4 , 11 and 30 mean that heavy metals have to be separated from the waste before recycling .
The Commission considers that the type of phas@@ ing-@@ out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view .
Amendments Nos 17 , 18 , 27 , 34 , 36 , 38 , 44 and 45 relate to the manufacturer &apos; s liability .
The compromise reached by the Council is fair but fragile . The Commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without , at the same time , creating tensions .
I regret the confusion which aro@@ se recently due to internal documents from the Commission being wron@@ g@@ ly used , so creating uncertainty about the Commission &apos; s attitude to the issue .
I want to emphasise that , as early as 1997 , the Commission proposed a special clause concerning manufacturer &apos; s liability and that the Commission entirely supports the common position .
This does not impose dis@@ proportionate costs upon manufacturers . Far from it .
Amendments Nos 39 , 40 , 46 and 47 concern quanti@@ fied objectives .
The high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year 2006 were removed .
These amendments would also make the objectives aw@@ k@@ ward to deal with and difficult to super@@ vise .
Allow me also - listen carefully to what I am saying now , because I have heard this reiter@@ ated in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vin@@ tage and &quot; cher@@ ished &quot; cars as mentioned in Amendments Nos 3 , 7 , and 9 , section 2 , and 35 .
Such vehicles are not covered by the definition of waste and are not therefore included under the directive .
So , whatever has been stated in this regard , vin@@ tage cars and motor@@ cycles are not included under the directive .
We do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive .
Amendment No 23 involves the Commission &apos; s having to adopt quality standards for re@@ usable components .
This is not covered by the directive .
An ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the European Parliament and the Council .
Amendments Nos 29 , 31 and 41 water down the requirements concerning the dismant@@ ling of vehicles .
There is a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic , ty@@ res and glass .
Finally , the Commission cannot approve Amendments Nos 1 and 33 for reasons to do with legal clarity ; nor Amendment No 19 , which the Commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage .
Furthermore , Amendment No 43 does not fall within the directive &apos; s area of applic@@ ability .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
Vo@@ te
Madam President , as you know , the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the numerous and serious translation errors , particularly in the French version .
You have received a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistakes in this report and in other reports with which I have had deal@@ ings recently .
There is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on Amendment No 4 .
In the English version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations . In the French version that becomes &apos; entre@@ prises pharmaceu@@ tiques et organisations scienti@@ fi@@ ques &apos; .
Could you please make sure that Fren@@ ch-@@ speaking Members of this House know that the word entre@@ prises is not correct .
It should not be in the amendment .
And , again , I urge you , Madam President , to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently .
Madam President , I would simply like to point out that during the procedure , we were not allowed either to table or , consequently , adopt amendments in the Committee .
I do not know whether this is in order , and I would therefore ask you to verify the accuracy of the procedure which was followed before this report reached the House .
I have taken note of your comment , Mr Sper@@ oni .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Report ( A5-00@@ 18 / 2000 ) by Mr Dim@@ it@@ ra@@ kop@@ ou@@ los and Mr L@@ einen , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the conven@@ ing of the Intergovernmental Conference ( 14@@ 0@@ 94 / 1999 - C5-0@@ 3@@ 41 / 1999 - 1999 / 0@@ 8@@ 25 ( CNS ) )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Joint motion for a resolution on the negotiations to form a government in Austria
Madam President , we simply have a few translation problems in this area too .
We consider the English version to be the original text .
To give you an example , in both paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Dutch and German versions , the equi@@ val@@ ents of the English words : &quot; in so far as &quot; have been om@@ itted .
This is why I would ask you to consider the English version as the original version .
Thank you , Mr van Vel@@ zen .
In response I shall say the same thing I said to Mrs Mc@@ N@@ ally just now .
I am very concerned about these translation problems which , unfortunately , we seem to be having increasingly , and I can assure you that we shall look into the matter very seriously indeed .
In any case , the authorit@@ ative version is always , of course , the original language version .
- ( FR ) I am pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the Commission entitled &apos; Women and Science &apos; .
In this document , the Commission proposes to stimulate debate with a view to promoting the increased participation of women in research in Europe .
This objective deserves our total support .
Ex@@ pen@@ di@@ ture on research and technology actually forms a si@@ ze@@ able part of the budget of the European Union , after agriculture and the Structural Funds .
The various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various Member States .
Rel@@ atively few women , however , are active in scientific discipl@@ ines despite the excellent results they achieve in their studies .
It is unacceptable for women to continue to be under@@ represented .
I am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the European Commission .
The Commission document sets out to focus on the initiatives to be taken at Community level , especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development , which is quite obviously something I approve of .
The goal for the years to come is to increase women &apos; s participation to achieve a rate of 40 % female participation in the Marie Cur@@ ie grants , in consult@@ ative assemb@@ lies and in evaluation panels for the whole of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development .
Furthermore , like the rapporteur , I think that studies must be undertaken to analyse the reasons for the gap between the number of women with science degrees and the number of women who manage to have a career in these fields .
Im@@ proved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles .
We will have to en@@ list the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in fr@@ aming a joint research policy .
The European Parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development as regards the promotion of women and to come up with ideas for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development .
We must incorporate the gender factor in science , research and all other European Union policies , in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevents women competing on equal terms in the labour market .
In its communication &quot; Women and Science &quot; , the European Commission inform@@ s us of its good intentions of en@@ listing the support of women to en@@ rich research in Europe .
This is very good , and we are pleased to see it .
The fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the European Union .
We know that we can change this situation , in which women are under@@ represented in the science sector , only by means of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a greater range of career choices for girls and , when they have obtained their degrees , by means of positive measures at the professional level .
Having said this , some of our fellow Members clearly have qual@@ ms because the report by the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equ@@ al Opport@@ unities which we have voted on contains one point which may lead to confusion and is interpreted by some as a quota stipul@@ ating that there must be 40 % female participating in research in Europe .
This is pat@@ ently not the case , since such a quota would not be realistic .
Indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved .
To set my fellow Members &apos; minds at ease and to re@@ assure them , I have tabled an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the Commission , in its communication , under@@ takes to make significant efforts to increase women &apos; s participation in Community research programmes , which is , after all , a pra@@ is@@ e@@ worthy goal .
And why should we not note that the Commission &apos; s communication stipul@@ ates specifically that it considers a 40 % minimum level to be a crucial goal for women &apos; s participation at all levels in the implementation and management of research programmes ?
It is not a quota ! It is a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the Commission , in@@ sofar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of Member States .
The latter would be well advised , however , to follow the good example of the Commission , for once , and make the same efforts in their own research programmes .
People must realise this !
I am pleased to see that the debate on Mrs Mc@@ N@@ ally &apos; s report with a view to increasing and facilitating women &apos; s participation in profes@@ sions in research and science , met with a fairly wide consensus .
This necessary realistic and pragmatic policy , however , which will have to be associated with the elimination of the practical obstacles identified as un@@ question@@ able factors in this inequality must , as far as we are concerned , necessarily be based on the idea of compl@@ ement@@ arity , which is the only one capable of justi@@ fying a pro@@ active policy on the subject .
Since the European Parliament chose to vote on a text that expressly res@@ or@@ ted to the quota policy which my report for an opinion had attempted to den@@ ounce in no uncertain terms , and in spite of the general approach which I approve for the most part , I can do no other than ab@@ stain from the vote on Mrs Mc@@ N@@ ally &apos; s report .
Second reading of the Florenz report ( A5-00@@ 06 / 2000 )
Madam President , today in the second reading we have voted on the amendments to the Directive on end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles .
I have rejected the entire directive , not least because Amendment No 34 to Article 12 and the amendments to Article 5 / 4 have not received an adequate majority here in the House .
I come from a country which manufac@@ tures 50 % of the cars in the EU and it is precisely the free collection of end-@@ of-@@ life cars which is so financially on@@ erous and unacceptable .
Here , in my opinion , the labour market is also considerably bur@@ dened by the costs arising to these companies .
This cannot be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever min@@ d@@ ful of employment .
I consider that this is a serious defect and that , in principle , it does not be@@ fit our legal system .
In my opinion , this directive is unacceptable for this reason .
Madam President , I would like to comment on the Florenz report .
I think that the vote has shown that although the common position of the Council has been t@@ oned down , the major groups here ( and above all the German deleg@@ ates of the major groups ) have not , thank God , succeeded in destroying the heart of the directive , namely manufacturer responsibility .
Unfortunately , there has been a t@@ oning down of the effective ecological material flow policy , i.e. through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years .
We know that lead , mer@@ cury , cad@@ mium and h@@ ex@@ av@@ al@@ ent ch@@ ro@@ mium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restric@@ ting their usage without any risk assessment being made .
Here , unfortunately , the European Parliament has b@@ owed to the interests of industry .
I am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of Florenz , Lange and others who have actually sought to le@@ ver out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles .
I found this to be an extremely sham@@ eful attempt and I am pleased that it failed , that the attempt by one large government and the deleg@@ ates of a large Member State did not gain a majority , by which I mean the attempt to domin@@ ate the voting process of the European Parliament on grounds of the interests of its national industries .
Madam President , although I too have spent most of my life in fast cars , I agree with my colleague , Mr Florenz , that the directive on scra@@ pping cars must make it clear that vin@@ tage cars are not included .
These splendid cars do not constitute waste .
That is why I voted in favour of the amendments .
Neither can we fix what the age for a vin@@ tage car should be as there are very great differences from one country &apos; s stat@@ utes to another &apos; s .
In this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations .
We cannot forget old car enthusiasts either , of whom there are more than 50 000 in Finland alone .
They are involved in low-@@ profile work of valuable cultural importance .
- ( SV ) The parliamentary process concerning this question has been conf@@ using , to say the least .
Before the vote at the plenary sitting , new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the Committee .
In the divided situation which has now ar@@ isen , we therefore consider that the Council &apos; s wor@@ dings are the best .
We need a directive in this area , and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure .
The directive concerning end-@@ of-@@ life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation .
It is therefore important that the manufacturer &apos; s liability should be clear . This should not in any way be jeop@@ ardis@@ ed .
Today , Parliament is examining , for the last time , this text on &apos; end-@@ of-@@ life &apos; vehicles and what is to be done with them : their destruction , a comm@@ end@@ able intention with regard to our environment .
There are , however , two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text .
First of all , who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction ?
We must all ensure that it is not always the same person , i.e. the vehicle owner , who pays .
He or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle , which is a bot@@ tom@@ less pit in financial terms .
We have recently had cause to talk about the &apos; poll@@ uter pays &apos; principle .
We should apply this principle ration@@ ally and cal@@ mly , correctly targeted and without ideology .
Another essential point that must be included in this text is the express exclusion of vin@@ tage vehicles from its scope .
One might make the claim that there is no need to state it explicitly in writing because it is an obvious point , but I feel that it is a point that should be made in writing because there is every interest in adopting clear texts .
So let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these gem@@ s of the automobile industry .
These old vehicles are testim@@ ony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by Europe , if we are not to water down each of our specific identi@@ ties .
There is no lack of examples amongst European texts , and we all know how much debate and argument is caused by a lack of clarity and precision .
I only need to mention the case of Direc@@ tives 79 / 4@@ 09 and 92 / 43 .
The precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis .
It is not the job of the MEP to generate li@@ tig@@ ation or legal proceedings for judges in any arena .
That would not be fulfilling our mission .
On the contrary , we must adopt cryst@@ al-@@ clear texts in order to limit legal disputes .
.
( NL ) That the Florenz report has caused such a sti@@ r has been proven by the powerful lobby machine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement .
I regret that the manufacturers have har@@ an@@ gu@@ ed the European Parliament and the Council with a whole re@@ am of arguments which either cut no ice or were simply false .
I dare say this because I took the trouble to go into the field and collect information from , among others , sc@@ rap@@ yards which already recy@@ cle car components successfully .
They made it clear to me that the arguments concerning lack of safety , for example , are non@@ sense .
The car lobby was un@@ successful today and I am pleased about that .
The directive remains in place .
I expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the efforts to achieve a better living environment will tri@@ umph over un@@ reasonable industrial requirements .
- My party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments .
There are few things more certain in life than taxes , death and pollution .
However , there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental directives which have lau@@ dable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives .
When it comes to pollution , like sin , we are all against it , but from there it is a far c@@ ry from believ@@ ing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good .
In fact , this directive , like so many others addressing environmental issues , is not good .
As is so often the case , it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem , which will only serve to create more jobs for officials , and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money .
The one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sle@@ d@@ geh@@ ammer to miss a n@@ ut .
No one , not least my party , could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged , but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market , not to create another bureaucratic mon@@ stro@@ sity .
Thus , a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recover@@ able material in their vehicles , to encourage private sector recycling companies , through a package of tax incentives and assistance on compl@@ ying with environmental requirements , and to incen@@ tiv@@ ise the use of recy@@ c@@ led materials .
Of course , these are areas where the EU does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction .
However , in the absence of these powers , it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure .
Instead , it should leave Member States to develop their own systems , and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good .
Ber@@ ger Report ( A5-00@@ 07 / 2000 )
This proposal for a directive attempts to establish conditions for the posting of workers who are third-country nationals , for the provision of cross-border services . Thir@@ d-@@ country nationals with a permanent right of residence in one Member State do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the European Union .
Until now , the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the Union of non-@@ Community workers have been very harsh .
It is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the European Union is being made easier , even when they are nationals of third countries .
Nevertheless , the proposal for a directive merely aims to allow them to move to another Member State when they are posted there by an employ@@ er based in their country of normal residence . This means that their scope for movement is limited to the duration of their posting and only to the Member State to which they were posted .
This means that this proposal &apos; s fundamental aim is not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these workers , but merely to improve the position of the companies providing services .
On the other hand , for the sake of simpli@@ fying procedures some highly debat@@ able amendments have been included in the Ber@@ ger report , one example of which is the establishment of a common information service for cards issued by a body in any Member State .
Ber@@ ger Report ( A5-00@@ 07 / 2000 ) and Ber@@ ger Report ( A5-00@@ 12 / 2000 )
It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives intended to facilitate the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of a third country while facilitating the freedom of movement of services .
Basi@@ cally , these proposals introduce the EU service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country nationals legally resident in a European Union Member State to provide services in other Member States , a phenomenon currently ob@@ struc@@ ted by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits .
The first proposal for a directive will author@@ ise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assi@@ gn such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there .
According to the terms of the directive , the employ@@ er would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned .
Log@@ ically , in order to be given such a card , the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be covered by a social security scheme .
The second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed workers who are third country nationals .
While , basically , I subscribe to the European Commission proposals , nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion .
That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur . This will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any mis@@ reading !
Other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures , for example by author@@ ising Member States to design@@ ate a single authority responsible for issuing cards .
I feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative un@@ wi@@ el@@ din@@ ess which too often acts as a bra@@ ke on the proper application of new conditions .
I can , therefore , only be delighted at the adoption of these directives thus amended . We could not really toler@@ ate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the European Union had to face so many problems .
This goes against the fundamental principle of non-@@ discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this Union .
Marin@@ ho Report ( A5-00@@ 03 / 2000 ) :
We have serious reservations about the Council &apos; s proposed amendments .
How can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the Court of First In@@ stance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that Court because it is over@@ stret@@ ched ?
The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter .
Some people will say that perf@@ ection is not a realistic aim , but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them :
On 1 January 1995 , the Council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in Article 17 of the Acc@@ ession Treaty of 24 June 1994 .
So what was done at Amsterdam ?
In that respect , nothing . On the contrary , extending the Community &apos; s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden .
You will agree , furthermore , that the texts adopted by this House always call for Community jurisdiction , and that includes for the Charter of Fundamental Rights which is currently being drawn up .
The increase in the number of CF@@ I judges from 15 to 21 and the opportunity it has recently been accord@@ ed to have a single judge rule on specific cases are not real solutions but mere de@@ co@@ ys , gru@@ d@@ g@@ ingly granted , which we have become aware of after the fact .
Consequently , these proposals do not live up to the issues at stake . They represent a down@@ ward spir@@ al which in the long term would require the number of judges to be increased to several hundred .
We cannot agree to this , since such a si@@ del@@ ong shift towards a Europe of the Ju@@ dges is detri@@ mental to the proper exercise of democracy in our States .
The time has come , we feel , for in-depth consideration of how to put the Community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice .
This question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarch@@ y of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity .
Is the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference not the ideal opportunity for this ?
Dim@@ it@@ ra@@ kop@@ ou@@ los and L@@ einen Report ( A5-00@@ 18 / 2000 )
- ( SV ) The most important task of the approaching Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States .
We therefore , of course , support the European Parliament &apos; s now giving the formal go@@ -@@ ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference .
We nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place .
We also argued this in November 1999 , and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 .
. ( FR ) In the opinion which it has just adopted on the conven@@ ing of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , the European Parliament calls for a &quot; constitutional process to be launched &quot; .
This determination to over@@ ride nations with a legally supran@@ ational text is also expressed in the first meetings of the body responsible for drawing up the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights , which is really a clos@@ et constitution .
It is expressed again in the un@@ believ@@ able excess perpet@@ rated by the European Parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in Austria .
The same determination to reduce nations to the level of mere administrative regions is also evident on every page of the opinion issued by the Commission for the Intergovernmental Conference .
The key idea involves making qualified majority voting the general rule while modi@@ fying the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority , of States and peoples , in order to increase the Commission &apos; s room for manoeu@@ vre and reduce that of the minority States .
In@@ ci@@ dentally , the French will probably be interested to learn that the Commission is asking for Article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament .
People will remember that this article , dealing with the transfer of immigration policy to the Community level , stipul@@ ated that for five years decisions would still be taken by unanimous vote in the Council and there@@ after the Council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system .
In France , both in the National Assembly and in the Sen@@ ate , when this was being ratified , many members of the French parliament were re@@ assured to hear that , in any case , the Council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision-making .
Well , today , the same Minister of European Affairs who drew up the Treaty of Amsterdam , who has , in the meantime , become a European Commissioner , Mr Barnier , proposes to decide , at the forthcoming IGC , that the Council will operate in these areas by majority decision .
This is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of European integration with the Brussels institutions .
The French must be made aware not only that the purpose of all these operations is to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision making , but that furthermore every means will be used to extract their consent .
If they yield , they are lost . For it is their very means of defence which are being eliminated one by one .
.
( DA ) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the report on the conven@@ ing of the Intergovernmental Conference .
It is crucial for us that it should be possible for this Intergovernmental Conference to be concluded before the end of the year 2000 so that there are no remaining form@@ alities , such as the weigh@@ ting of votes in the Council of Ministers and the composition of the Commission and the European Parliament , which place obstacles in the way of the enlargement of the EU .
We were therefore also very satisfied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the Helsinki Summit in December .
An un@@ duly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk del@@ aying the enlargement process .
That is something we do not want to see , and we have therefore voted against any such extension .
We nonetheless very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceed@@ ing .
.
( SV ) We are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Conference .
Pos@@ sible future Member States ought to be involved in , and have an influence upon , the shaping of the EU of the future .
The elections to the European Parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more feder@@ alist EU cent@@ red upon Brussels .
With the conven@@ ing of the forthcoming IGC , the process of European Union is topical once again .
Once again the discussion is going to be mon@@ opoli@@ sed by the Heads of State and Government . In other words , fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide , behind closed doors , on the fate of more than 350 million individuals .
It is therefore easy to understand the public &apos; s lack of interest , given the construction of Europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them .
In fact , one only need look at the agenda of the IGC : the institutions , enlargement and European defence .
The fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power , the development of closer relations with liber@@ alism in the countries of Eastern Europe and the rel@@ a@@ unch of the militar@@ isation of Europe , particularly by increasing military budgets .
Social Europe , used as a fo@@ il by the EU , has simply been eliminated from the agenda .
All this does is to legitim@@ ise the development , on the European scale , of resistance movements anx@@ ious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers &apos; main claims towards the highest common den@@ omin@@ ator .
This is why I am voting against the report .
I voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of conven@@ ing the IGC . I did so because it sums up the philosophy of the Portuguese Presidency , which is supported by a broad majority in Parliament , of opening up the IGC agenda beyond issues strictly related to red@@ res@@ sing the balance of power between Member States , large and small , as was originally stated when the Helsinki Council was conven@@ ed .
Unfortunately , in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for re@@ visions to the Treaty on European Union , nothing has so far been stated about the need to review Article 7 , which deals with susp@@ ending a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the &quot; founding &quot; principles of the Union , as laid down in Article 6 .
As the present crisis involving Austria has demonstrated , the Union has the right to protect itself .
Nevertheless , the legal mechanisms that exist in the Treaty are weak , difficult to apply politically and legally , do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance . Sus@@ pending a state is just such a process , and is to be condemned .
I therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda , and in itself this justi@@ fies a thorough revision of the Treaties .
We feel that at present the central issues about conven@@ ing an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties are far more important than the contro@@ vers@@ y taking place here about the size of the agenda . They are also more important than the contro@@ vers@@ y over the appropri@@ at@@ eness or otherwise of form@@ ulating proposals for new issues to be covered , and more important than the contro@@ vers@@ y over the extent of Parliament &apos; s participation in it .
We feel that these issues result from the IGC &apos; s appropri@@ at@@ eness and its objectives , as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there .
We have doubts concerning the appropri@@ at@@ eness of the IGC because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged .
This relates in particular to the intended agenda , particularly as regards the Amsterdam le@@ f@@ to@@ vers , which suggests that unacceptable inner cab@@ in@@ ets will be created in the future . This also identi@@ fies areas relating to the second and third pillars , which tend to be reflected in an undes@@ irable militar@@ isation of the European Union .
These are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us .
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the L@@ einen Dim@@ it@@ ra@@ kop@@ ou@@ los Report .
The text is over@@ ambitious , and Britain &apos; s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the &quot; Amsterdam left-@@ over@@ s &quot; in order to prepare for enlargement , and not expand far beyond these .
There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions .
Expan@@ sion of the agenda and dr@@ astic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-@@ stabili@@ sation .
The key factor in this text as it has been amended , is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties .
In our view , this would bring with it a complex legislative burden , and it would be prefer@@ able to have a political and declar@@ atory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are .
Our priorities ( i.e. the &quot; left-@@ over@@ s &quot; ) must be :
the number and responsibilities of Commissioners
weigh@@ ting of votes in the Council
extension of Q@@ M@@ V in areas where it will benefit the UK and Europe ( but not Treaty change , defence matters , border controls or taxation ) , and extension of codecision wherever Q@@ M@@ V is extended
Beyond this , we have concerns that the &quot; flexibility &quot; or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present .
The provisions of Amsterdam are largely un@@ tested and allowing more scope for op@@ t-@@ outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation .
- ( SV ) In order to be able to influence developments , the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference than emerg@@ es from the present resolution , which displays far too much disappointment and neg@@ ativity about the decision which the European Council made in Helsinki in December 1999 .
The European Parliament and its Committee on Constitutional Affairs ought instead to have been more specific and concentrated on just a few points in addition to the Council decision in Helsinki , so stating what it considered to be the most pressing matters for discussion , including the question of establishing a public prosec@@ utor to deal with crimes against the institutions of the European Union and their financial interests .
We Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the EU to the east if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in 1997 .
The most important task of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States .
I therefore , of course , support the European Parliament &apos; s now giving the formal go@@ -@@ ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference .
I nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for the enlargement to take place .
I also refer to my explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 which clari@@ fies my attitude towards supran@@ ation@@ alism and common defence .
Joint resolution on Austria
Madam President , the Union for a Europe of Nations Group did not associ@@ ate itself with the joint PPE / D@@ E-@@ PSE resolution on the political situation in Austria following the formation in that country of a coalition government between the conserv@@ atives and J@@ ör@@ g Hai@@ der &apos; s Freedom Party .
This PPE / D@@ E-@@ PSE resolution comm@@ ends the initiative taken by four@@ teen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boy@@ cot@@ t .
What we find most sho@@ cking is the fact that this joint intervention claims the authority of the Treaty , as if this stated somewhere that hen@@ ce@@ forth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancelled by the will of the heads of government of neighbouring countries who in fact , in this instance , have carefully refra@@ ined from consulting their own peoples .
Whatever J@@ ör@@ g Hai@@ der &apos; s verb@@ al exc@@ esses , which we of course depl@@ ore , the Austri@@ ans have made a democratic choice , and we must respect this .
In our opinion , it is clear that the left wing in the European Parliament , in association with the Austrian left wing which was defe@@ ated in the electoral arena , have mounted a pet@@ ty political campaign res@@ or@@ ting to the memory of a sin@@ ister but fortunately by@@ gone period .
Although compar@@ ing Hai@@ der to Hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever , it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in uns@@ ett@@ ling some PPE / DE Members of Parliament .
But , going beyond this pet@@ ty political operation , what the majority in the European Parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left-@@ right co@@ hab@@ itation in Austria , which caused political life to stag@@ n@@ ate and rot , may soon spread to the European system of co-@@ management which is producing equally appalling results .
In order to prevent this threat to the system , it is ready to do anything , including over@@ ruling the outcome of free elections , including setting up a thought police , including establishing a new form of totalit@@ ari@@ anism .
Madam President , on behalf of the Members of Parliament who represent the Front national , the V@@ la@@ ams Blo@@ k and the Mo@@ vi@@ men@@ to soci@@ ale itali@@ ano , I should like to ask the question : in this ou@@ trage@@ ous interference in internal Austrian affairs which the European Union has undertaken in contra@@ vention of general international law , in contra@@ vention of the Treaties , in contra@@ vention of mor@@ ality , who is pul@@ ling the str@@ ings ?
Is this h@@ yst@@ eria spont@@ aneous ?
Is it the product of mere foo@@ lish@@ ness or , more probably , of a deliber@@ ate strategy , which is the same throughout the world ?
Who is imposing their will on the nations of Europe , dar@@ ing to stop them choosing their own fate ?
Underground networks ?
The government of the United States , or of Israel ?
Or their Socialist back@@ -up troops who , in this House , have the che@@ ek to thr@@ ust their values down our thro@@ ats ?
What , then , are the values of these Socialists who fe@@ a@@ ther@@ ed their electoral n@@ est in the last century by painting the idea of greater social justice in g@@ lowing colours for the benefit of the under@@ privileged , and who today are nothing more than the party of protected civil servants , full-@@ time union officials and state capitalism ?
What are the values of the Belgian Socialist Party , which only goes from pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ lia sc@@ and@@ als to corruption sc@@ and@@ als , via V@@ and@@ am and A@@ gu@@ sta ?
What are the values of the French Socialist Party , which ext@@ or@@ ted money from all the town coun@@ cils under its thumb in the Ur@@ ba , S@@ ages and Gra@@ co sc@@ and@@ als ?
The party led by Franç@@ ois Mit@@ terr@@ and , decorated with the emb@@ lem of Mar@@ sh@@ al Pé@@ tain &apos; s Vi@@ chy government , the party whose leading lights have just been caught re@@ d-@@ handed once again , living a life of luxury on the public funds em@@ be@@ zz@@ led from the students &apos; mutual insurance company .
I shall not even mention the instances of corruption in the Italian Socialist Party , because it does not do to k@@ ick a man when he is down , still less when he is dead and gone .
I shall , however , mention the Spanish Socialist Party which has just formed an alliance with the but@@ chers of Alb@@ ac@@ ete and which settled its accounts with Basque nation@@ alists by hi@@ ring contract k@@ ill@@ ers .
I shall also mention the German Socialist Party which dar@@ es to pre@@ ach to us about the second world war , when it is international socialist in the way that its pe@@ ers were National Socialists , still goo@@ se-@@ step@@ ping , the party of the Waffen SS ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Madam President , I had a major problem with this resolution . Finally , I abstained on the vote for a number of reasons .
I was in sympathy with the ED@@ D Group amendment , talking about rej@@ ecting the interference of the EU in the formation of governments of Members States but I had to ab@@ stain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia , racism , etc. and I felt that it might be mis@@ interpreted .
However , I do wonder about the wisdom of this .
Firstly , there is the question of trying to combat intoler@@ ance with intoler@@ ance and the long-term consequences of that .
I also wonder about the wisdom of the EU and its reaction to the formation of the government in Austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there .
At the moment it seems that the Hai@@ der Party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments .
Even America has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations .
We wonder if this is actually feeding the fl@@ ames of xenophobia and the parties and people that support it .
I really think that people should be extremely cau@@ tious .
If you want to combat xenophobia and racism , and I believe that we should , we need to look at the root causes .
We need to look at the people who vote for these parties , and understand why this situation arises .
It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want , but we need to be careful about the approach we take , so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve .
Madam President , I strongly refu@@ te any statement , demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism .
I passion@@ ately defend Europe &apos; s heritage of human rights and the rule of law .
I disagree , however , for this very reason , with the sen@@ sel@@ ess actions taken by the Presidency - the Portuguese Presidency unfortunately - which have resulted in a real institutional bl@@ under on behalf of the other four@@ teen States .
This is not the way to fight extremis@@ m .
It may even be a way of doing extremis@@ m a great deal of good .
The tor@@ rent of confusion and ras@@ h actions that has been un@@ le@@ ashed over Austria has b@@ lown things out of all proportion . It has caused considerable dist@@ ress to decent citizens and ev@@ ok@@ es risks that had previously not even been considered .
There is an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law , but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the Austri@@ ans and ride rou@@ gh@@ sho@@ d over the basic ten@@ ets of the rule of law , in this case the standards laid down in the Treaties .
What are we actually seeking to achieve in embark@@ ing on an Intergovernmental Conference ?
A Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14 , or even fewer ?
We support Europe , a Europe which does honour to all the actions that have brought us to this point , a Europe which respects the Treaties and the law and a Europe which needs Austria .
This needs to be said !
Madam President , I am delighted and proud that this Parliament has , by an enormous majority , condemned the formation of the coalition in Austria incorpor@@ ating Mr Hai@@ der &apos; s Freedom Party .
Mr Hai@@ der has demonstrated , over the past years by both words and de@@ eds , that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic dis@@ course .
Not only has he ad@@ mi@@ red Ad@@ olf Hitler , pra@@ ised the Waffen SS , and refused to condemn a terrorist bom@@ bing that killed four Roma , but also in Car@@ in@@ th@@ ia has been a member of the regional government .
He has led efforts to end provision for Austria &apos; s Sloven@@ e-@@ speaking minority and assistance to immigrants .
Some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics .
They are wrong .
European Union Treaties make it inc@@ umb@@ ent on us to protect fundamental rights .
Some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections .
However , democratic elections do not make democ@@ rats of those who have threatened democracy .
There is the tragic monument of the Holoc@@ aust , the death of 6 million Jews , to those who argued the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930@@ s .
However , we should not condemn Mr Hai@@ der for ambition .
Leop@@ ards do not change their spots .
The real cul@@ pr@@ its are Austria &apos; s Christian Democ@@ rat acting as Ju@@ das go@@ ats to res@@ ur@@ rec@@ t a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945 .
Madam President , we have just passed a resolution which condem@@ ns the rac@@ ist and xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic record of J@@ ör@@ g Hai@@ der &apos; s Freedom Party in Austria , which has welcomed action by our governments to cut off political relations with any government of which he is part , and which sends our support to anti-@@ rac@@ ist groups within the democratic majority of the Austrian people .
We war@@ n that this coalition , if it is formed today , un@@ accept@@ ably legitim@@ ises the extreme right , directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation , which bring us together in this European Union .
These are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us .
This European Parliament requires the European Commission to be vigil@@ ant of any rac@@ ist action in Austria , and threatens to suspend Austria from membership of the European Union if this happens .
I am proud to support such a resolution .
Though our proposal to withdraw political inv@@ itations to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament has not carried today , I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-@@ Naz@@ is to government in Europe can and will be taken .
I shall take the floor very briefly , Madam President .
I respect Parliament &apos; s wish , as it has been expressed , but I must also say that the self-@@ determination of peoples cannot be called into question , even by the European Parliament .
The document is unfair both to Austrian Members of the European Parliament , and to members of the Austrian national parliament , and it sm@@ acks slightly of je@@ al@@ ous@@ y and political interests , but also of business .
I do not believe that these signals will change the citizens &apos; in@@ difference to Europe .
The Austrian extreme right has been gi@@ fted an un@@ warran@@ ted present .
I very much welcome the position taken by the Italian Ra@@ dic@@ als ; and I say this while making a clear historic and material distinction between Italian liber@@ als and Austrian liber@@ als .
I have for many years , in word and deed , been committed to the anti-@@ fasc@@ ist struggle and the stru@@ gg@@ les for equal rights and against xenophobia .
However , recent events - firstly , what were really threats by the Council of Ministers , then Mr Prodi &apos; s threats against the Austrian Commissioner and , finally , the present decision - are things I cannot support .
I have not been able to vote in favour of the present decision even though I agree with many of its premises .
What we have here , first and foremost , is an incredibly omin@@ ous mixture of power , arro@@ gan@@ ce and im@@ poten@@ ce on the part of the European Union .
Not only do these decisions conflict with the Treaty and ap@@ portion to the institutions of the Union more power than that to which they are entitled but , worst of all , their effect will be counter-@@ productive .
They will not weaken Mr Hai@@ der and the FP@@ Ö . On the contrary , they will strengthen them .
We shall obtain the very opposite of what we want .
That is not how you combat racism and a s@@ wing to the right .
.
( DA ) The Left &apos; s Members of the European Parliament attach importance to the fact that , with today &apos; s decision , Parliament has NOT supported the four@@ teen prime ministers &apos; diplomatic sanctions against Austria .
The Left &apos; s Members of Parliament therefore supported the Liberal decision &apos; s powerful rejection of any form of xenophobia in Austria or elsewhere .
We attach crucial importance to applying , if necessary , the new provisions under Article 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty so that a country which , by its actions , infr@@ ing@@ es fundamental citizens &apos; rights by means of discrimination and such like will have its voting rights in the EU &apos; s Council of Ministers removed .
- ( EL ) The Freedom Party &apos; s participation in the Austrian Government is a dangerous development for the European Union &apos; s political future .
It is a &apos; Tro@@ jan horse &apos; which is unfortunately re@@ appearing in Europe larger than ever since the Second World War .
The European Parliament and the Union &apos; s governments must politically isol@@ ate a government that includes admir@@ ers of Naz@@ ism and advocates of xenophobia .
In view of the fact that the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament do not permit us to table our own resolution condem@@ ning Hai@@ der &apos; s party , as well as all the parties throughout Europe which dis@@ semin@@ ate rac@@ ist s@@ lander and which are xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic and hosti@@ le to im@@ migrant workers , we voted in favour of the compromise resolution .
We did so even though we did not agree with some of its rec@@ it@@ als or terms , in order to show our solidarity with all those in Austria itself who are opposing the Austrian extreme right and its de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ ery .
Our vote in no way constitutes an endor@@ sement of the sign@@ atories to this compromise resolution , their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious .
Some of these parties , despite declar@@ ing themselves to be re@@ public@@ an and democratic , adopt the de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ ery of the extreme right , either out of con@@ ni@@ v@@ ance or as a vot@@ e-@@ winning p@@ lo@@ y , if only in openly and hypo@@ cri@@ tically bl@@ aming the im@@ migrant workers in our countries for unemployment , and generally making their lives more difficult .
More generally , those sign@@ atories who take part in or have taken part in government in the various States of the European Union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right has managed to gain since their policy , devoted exclusively to the interests of big business , has not included taking action likely to eradic@@ ate unemployment and the poverty it en@@ gen@@ ders , and has thus facilit@@ ated the xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ ery of the extreme right .
This week we heard the first political c@@ ry of the new@@ -@@ born Europe .
By staun@@ ch@@ ly and spe@@ edi@@ ly den@@ o@@ unc@@ ing the participation of J@@ ör@@ g Hai@@ der &apos; s xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic and anti-@@ European party in the Austrian government , a situation without precedent since the second world war , the European Union has come into its political birth@@ right and has confirmed that it is not merely an economic and financial Community , a large market , a &quot; Europe of sh@@ op@@ ke@@ ep@@ ers &quot; .
It is a part of its future which is at stake right now , part of its very essence , its heart and soul .
The European Parliament was the first to speak up .
The appeal by the European Socialists , on the initiative of Oli@@ vier Du@@ ham@@ el , raised awareness and enabled there to be a firm and immediate political response to this un@@ heard of and intoler@@ able situation . A firm attitude which the 14 European States have demonstrated unanimously and promptly , through Mr Gu@@ terr@@ es , by condem@@ ning the risk of the Austrian political situation getting out of control .
This courage@@ ous stance turns a new page in the construction of Europe .
A return to the roots , at last , for a Community built on the basis of the determination to turn our backs on a past history mar@@ red by hat@@ red and exclusion and of adher@@ ence to the human@@ ist values of openness and tolerance .
Europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events .
However , as it lacks the legal instruments to support this political will , since the sanctions stipul@@ ated under Article 7 of the Treaties are virtually impossible to apply , will it be able to keep its head high in the face of the threat of the systematic blocking of its entire institutional structure ?
The whole credibility of Europe is at stake today , before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracies of the former eastern blo@@ c to join us tomorrow .
From now on Europe must put its words into action if it wishes to show the world the scope of its re@@ discovered ambition .
At this time when we are voting on a joint resolution against the inclusion of neo-@@ Naz@@ is in the government of a European Union Member State , I must express my reg@@ rets regarding a compromise text which is particularly lacking in back@@ bone .
I am voting in favour of it because it is in@@ concei@@ vable that the European Parliament , after its excellent political debate yesterday , should not adopt a stance on this matter .
Person@@ ally , however , I shall continue to fight against the extreme right , to urge people to sign a petition to demand measures which may go as far as the exclusion of Austria , and to organise a major public demonstration in L@@ ille on Saturday at 3 p.m.
Fas@@ c@@ ism and neo-@@ Naz@@ ism are canc@@ ers !
The f@@ oul mon@@ ster has been re@@ aw@@ ak@@ ened !
For me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flour@@ ish without fighting with all our might .
Europe was born out of a desire for peace , freedom and tolerance .
There is no question of it allowing xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic , rac@@ ist and anti@@ -S@@ emi@@ tic ministers to be toler@@ ated at within it .
Do not count on me to keep quiet , without doing or saying anything .
In yesterday &apos; s debate in the European Parliament some Members of this Parliament expressed worry that we were inter@@ fer@@ ing in the internal affairs of a Member State .
Such a concern is mis@@ placed .
The European Parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in Member States with which they disagree .
We have condemned Basque and Irish terrorism .
We have opposed racism and the infringement of the rights of minorities .
It is our responsibility as a parliament , particularly as the democratically elected voice of the European Union , to comment on current political developments in Austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament .
By comm@@ enting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in Austria from forming a coalition government .
We are nonetheless , as is our right as well as our responsibility , telling them that if they go ahead then there are consequences arising from such a decision and in fact we are warning them be@@ foreh@@ and .
Others would argue that we should suspend jud@@ gement until we see the detail of such an agreement .
Such a view is not only a political cop@@ -@@ out , it is positively dangerous .
In reaching an agreement with J@@ ör@@ g Hai@@ der and his party , the Austrian Christian Democrats would at a stro@@ ke be confir@@ ming political resp@@ ect@@ ability on right wing extremis@@ m and also giving them access to power - both of which they will utili@@ se as a launching p@@ ad for even greater electoral success .
That is why the European Union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in Austria .
- ( SV ) We have voted in favour of the common resolution in order to express our solidarity with all those who are exposed to xenophobia and racism . We have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the det@@ est@@ able politics that J@@ ör@@ g Hai@@ der stands for .
We are nonetheless very critical of the methods which the 14 Member States have employed on this issue .
The resolution makes no clear reference to respect for the Member States &apos; national identi@@ ties and constitutional traditions in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty .
What is also missing is a paragraph concerning the EU &apos; s shared responsibility for the social and political developments in Europe and Austria which have been among the prior conditions for Mr Hai@@ der &apos; s electoral success .
Today , as previously in the history of Europe , right-@@ wing extremis@@ m is the result of in@@ secure social and economic conditions of life .
The policy of cut@@ -@@ backs which has followed in the wake of adju@@ sting to EMU has promoted the successes of right-@@ wing extremis@@ m .
A radical policy to promote security and justice in each country is the best guarantee of democratic development in Europe .
- ( DE ) I am making this statement on behalf of the CS@@ U .
It is intoler@@ able that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State .
It has no right to do so .
Instead of pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely condem@@ ning the FP@@ Ö and the Austrian Government which is being formed , there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition .
Only after such critical app@@ ra@@ is@@ al of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe .
This does not mean that we sympath@@ ise with Hai@@ der .
The CS@@ U European deleg@@ ates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FP@@ Ö .
However , as politicians we must ask the question why 27 % of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FP@@ Ö at the elections in October 1999 .
We must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results .
Only by tackling the arguments and policies of the FP@@ Ö can we prevent a radic@@ alisation of Austrian politics .
However , the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem .
For these reasons the CS@@ U European deleg@@ ates are against this resolution .
It is with these phr@@ ases that Albert Cam@@ us , at the close of the long alleg@@ or@@ ical novel descri@@ bing the difficult fight of the citizens of the town of Or@@ an against the pl@@ ague , remin@@ ds us , at the close of the Second World War , that the fight against Naz@@ ism , &quot; the brown pl@@ ague &quot; as it was ter@@ med at the time , could not enjoy a definitive victory .
That because ra@@ cial hat@@ red , xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic violence , fear and rejection of what is different , have deep roots in all that is bas@@ est in humanity , they may re-@@ emerge at any moment and take over any group of human beings .
In this light , the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic .
For the first time since the Second World War , a party which is openly pro-@@ Nazi , rac@@ ist and xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic has gained access to power in a European country .
This human diversity is our main sources of wealth , and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it , wherever it may exist .
For all these reasons I voted most deci@@ de@@ dly in favour of the resolution before this House on the formation of the government in Austria .
J@@ ör@@ g Hai@@ der &apos; s rise to power , with the inau@@ gur@@ ation of a conservative right-@@ wing and FP@@ Ö coalition government , is a sign of the terrible revi@@ val in Europe of a mon@@ ster to which liber@@ alism has given birth .
The success of the Austrian Freedom Party ow@@ es as much to the endor@@ sement of resp@@ ect@@ ability provided by the Austrian right wing and social democ@@ rats as to the policy of the latter , whose social disasters p@@ aved the way for extreme right-@@ wing populi@@ sm .
The resolution stipul@@ ates possible diplomatic means to isol@@ ate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the res@@ ur@@ gence of Fas@@ c@@ ism . It can be explained by the feeling of hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness of the people who are the victims of the ideology of mi@@ ghty M@@ amm@@ on and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and dereg@@ ulation ever further .
In order to oppose the xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic statements of an app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce dict@@ ator who is no@@ st@@ alg@@ ic for the Third Reich , we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austri@@ ans opposed to Fas@@ c@@ ism .
This is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypo@@ critical references to a &apos; European democratic model &apos; which bears more res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance to a fortress which tracks down@@ s , exp@@ els and impris@@ ons immigrants without the proper papers , when it is not opening files on teen@@ agers .
- ( DE ) I have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Austria in view of a possible government being formed between the Ö@@ VP and the FP@@ Ö .
I consider the casting of J@@ ör@@ g Hai@@ der as &quot; Europe &apos;s scap@@ eg@@ o@@ at &quot; ( or even worse , neo-@@ Nazi and Super Rac@@ ist ) to be counter@@ productive .
Of course I , in no way , agree with the public@@ ised statements of this right-@@ wing populi@@ st and fully condemn xenophobia and any down@@ playing of the Hitler regime .
However , I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multip@@ ly Hai@@ der &apos;s adher@@ ents .
The EU must not do him an inv@@ alu@@ able PR service .
The strength of the FP@@ Ö can be tra@@ ced back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the Austrian soci@@ alists must bear the main responsibility .
It was only after they un@@ successfully so@@ lic@@ ited the FP@@ Ö to toler@@ ate a minority government and , obviously in v@@ ain , offered the Freedom Party minist@@ erial posts , that the SP@@ Ö begin its massive campaign against Hai@@ der .
It turned its threatened loss of power into an &quot; hero@@ ic battle for the preservation of values &quot; and an im@@ min@@ ent , pur@@ e-@@ and-@@ simple &quot; decision between democracy and non-@@ democracy &quot; .
This is a sme@@ ar on the voters in my neighbouring country which I cannot con@@ done .
We German Christian Democrats used another strategy in the battle against extrem@@ ists and clearly dis@@ associated ourselves from them .
We revealed the hol@@ low@@ ness of the re@@ public@@ ans who were nation@@ alistic , xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic and anti-@@ minority .
Today the re@@ public@@ ans are no longer represented in most local parliaments .
The German approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again .
It cannot be copied arbitr@@ arily since each Member State has its own specific conditions .
The Ö@@ VP ( Austrian People &apos;s Party ) , whose presence at European level we have also come to take for granted , is dar@@ ing to attempt a coalition for the sake of govern@@ ability in Austria .
It can only succeed if agreements are made which are soli@@ dly based on compliance with democratic principles .
The Council has become pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely involved without waiting for the results of the coalition negotiations or a programme of government .
This condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the Austrian Republic .
Sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye .
We must take up a reason@@ ed offensive against radic@@ als on both the right and the left .
I would have liked to see the same ou@@ trage in Europe when the soci@@ alists were prepared to make common cause with the success@@ ors to the mis@@ an@@ throp@@ ic and persec@@ ut@@ ory regime in the D@@ DR .
In the meantime , they have been forming governments in German federal states .
I fully support the statements made by Commissioner Prodi in today &apos;s session .
He spoke of the task of not isol@@ ating Member States but of doing everything to unite them in common European values .
- ( FR ) I voted against the joint resolution on the situation in Austria .
Austria is a free , independent and sovereign country .
Consequently , neither the Council , the Commission nor the European Parliament has the right to interfere in the internal administration of a Member State .
The Austrian elections were held in a free , proper and democratic manner .
Any interference by the European institutions in this country is therefore unacceptable ; it is in violation of the European Treaty ( Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam ) .
Nevertheless , these same institutions showed no reluc@@ t@@ ance to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union , despite its well-known human rights violations .
Nothing of this nature has yet occurred in Austria .
On the one hand , the political ex@@ communication of Austria only demonstrates the worrying influence of con@@ form@@ ist thought . On the other hand , if tomorrow the governments of European Union Member States must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endor@@ sement of supran@@ ational bodies , then the very principle of democracy will be destroyed .
In such circumstances will it even be worth having elections ?
This is not the way to create the conditions for the nations of Europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future .
- ( FR ) The vote which has just taken place in this Chamber is a historic one for it is the first time we have ever debated the internal political situation of one of our Member States with such anx@@ i@@ ety .
I believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is ob@@ liter@@ ated .
I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the Union .
I urge the Commission to be less cau@@ tious .
In this resolution , Parliament is assuming its responsibilities .
Having said that , in my opinion , the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum , the very least we could do .
Person@@ ally I argued in favour of a rather harder line , and I supported Amendments Nos 1 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 , as well as the oral amendment tabled by the Socialist Group .
In fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an Austrian Government which includes members of the Austrian Freedom Party .
Inclu@@ ding J@@ ör@@ g Hai@@ der &apos; s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe , and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious after@@ math in other Union Member States or in candidate countries .
The Austrian People &apos; s Party must accept some historical responsibility for this .
It is our fundamental values which are at stake here .
As the democratically elected representatives of the European people , we have no choice .
We must reject what is unacceptable , as our constitu@@ ents demand .
Because , when the spec@@ tre of barbar@@ ism res@@ ur@@ faces , failure to oppose is t@@ ant@@ amount to capit@@ ulation .
I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution .
I condemn J@@ ör@@ g Hai@@ der &apos; s rac@@ ist and xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic policy .
However , I cannot accept that an EU body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one Member State .
I cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution , and I cannot vote in favour of the resolution , even though it would be a vote against the extreme right .
- ( SV ) Obviously , the political leaders of Europe have a right and a duty to react against Mr Hai@@ der and his party .
The political leaders of Europe are entitled to express their view of political developments in another Member State , just as a prime minister can express his opinion about rac@@ ist politicians in a local authority .
Finland &apos; s experience , however , is that integration , rather than isolation , is the better way of combating anti@@ democratic forces .
I therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution , which pres@@ up@@ poses that all parties have respect for human rights .
The EU Presidency &apos; s &quot; common reaction &quot; against the formation of the government in Austria is legally un@@ justified . The treaties do not author@@ ise this reaction by the 14 Member States .
Nor should we isol@@ ate the forces in Austria which wish to work for human rights .
Despite these objections of mine to the Council &apos; s action and despite my view that it is better to work for integration than to employ isol@@ ating tac@@ tics , it was important to show clearly where the European Parliament stands on questions of racism , which is why I voted in favour of the resolution at the final vote .
That concludes the vote .
Ad@@ journ@@ ment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament ad@@ jour@@ ned .
( The sitting was closed at 12.@@ 25 p.m. )
Res@@ um@@ ption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament ad@@ jour@@ ned on Thursday 3 February 2000 .
Appro@@ val of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the sitting on Thursday 3 February have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
I can see from your reaction that many of the Members of Parliament have not received the Minutes and clearly you cannot approve Minutes which you have not seen .
I therefore propose to submit the Minutes for your approval tomorrow morning , since obviously you do not have them and I must ap@@ olog@@ ise for this .
I shall therefore postp@@ one the approval of the Minutes .
Madam President , on a point of order .
The BBC this morning reported that a British Member of this House , holding a senior position within his delegation , continues to offer strategic advice to private clients , but does not state in the Register of Inter@@ ests who these clients are .
The people of Europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest separate from private profit , but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible .
Madam President , since these matters are currently being considered by the Qu@@ a@@ est@@ ors , may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Inter@@ ests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and , above all , to ensure that the Register is not only available for inspection by this House , but is also published on the Internet ?
Thank you , Mr Davi@@ es .
I shall look into this matter with the College of Qu@@ a@@ est@@ ors .
Madam President , on a point of order .
As this is the first Val@@ ent@@ ine &apos; s Day of the new millenni@@ um I hope that you will agree with me that it would be fitting for this House to mark this day by making a firm commitment to tackling heart disease , the biggest k@@ iller in the European Union .
I would urge Members to sign up to the commitment made today at the W@@ inning Hear@@ ts Conference that every child born in the new millenni@@ um has the right to live until the age of at least 65 without suffering from avo@@ idable car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disease .
Happ@@ y Val@@ ent@@ ine &apos; s Day !
Madam President , I rise under Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of this House and all@@ ude to the same point raised by Mr Davi@@ es about the very serious alleg@@ ations made on BBC radio this morning .
I would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two Members who were named in this particular BBC interview are not running their companies from this Parliament or from parliamentary offices , because that would be a very serious matter indeed .
In the past the British Conserv@@ atives &apos; double standards have brought the United Kingdom &apos; s House of Commons into dis@@ rep@@ ute , and there is a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this Parliament .
Thank you , Mr Mur@@ phy .
As I informed Mr Davi@@ es , I promise to look into this matter this very evening with the qu@@ a@@ est@@ ors .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I have already written to you on a number of occasions concerning how points of order are raised in the House .
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davi@@ es was speaking .
Why did he not mention the fact that one of his own Liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the BBC ?
Is this House going to let its agenda be determined by s@@ cur@@ ri@@ l@@ ous reports on a programme which bases its news items on lies , or is it going to get down to serious work and address the challenges facing Europe ?
Gent@@ lem@@ en , obviously the qu@@ a@@ est@@ ors who look into this matter are not going to be bas@@ ing their assessment just on information from radio programmes .
They will look into the matter thoroughly .
Madam President , I believe I am expressing the feeling of a great number of Members of Parliament in most of the political groups when I say that the message which the President of the Commission sent to the new Austrian Chancellor a week ago created some un@@ ease .
Was it in fact necessary in this message to specifically offer his best wishes for success , or to say , &quot; I am sure that you will demonstrate the same commitment as shown by your predec@@ essors to liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms &quot; , or indeed that he awa@@ ited productive and constructive cooperation ?
This is why , Madam President , I should like to see Mr Prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words , so that nobody , absolutely nobody , can use this message , which is unusual and un@@ wise , to say the least , to contribute , and that includes counter to the intentions of Mr Prodi , towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in Austria a comm@@ on@@ place .
Thank you , Mr Wur@@ tz .
I would ask you , ladies and gentlemen , not to start a debate at this point . This was just a procedural motion .
Let me remind you , Mr Wur@@ tz , that we shall be seeing Mr Prodi tomorrow . He is going to make a statement on the Commission &apos; s programme .
Naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him questions in the speeches you make following this statement , just as Mr Prodi will be perfectly free to answer you .
I suggest that you clarify this matter at that time , if you so wish and if Mr Prodi agrees .
Madam President , it is with great regret that I have to trouble you yet again with an issue that I have raised here twice before .
I have already told you on a number of occasions that we , on behalf of the Dutch contin@@ gency , would like a Dutch television channel .
There are now 28 channels here in this Parliament , including two Greek , one Portuguese , one Finnish and one Belgian , but still no Dutch , and as many as seven English , six German and six French .
I was promised back in September that there would be a Dutch channel by January .
It is now February and we are still waiting .
I would ask you once again to work on this .
I wonder what kind of medi@@ a@@ eval bureaucracy is at work here preventing a Dutch channel from being transmitted by satellite .
Mrs P@@ loo@@ ij@@ -@@ Van Gor@@ sel , let me say how disappointed I am , because I personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago .
I have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and I believe that Mrs Ban@@ otti has an answer for you .
I shall therefore , with your permission , give the floor to Mrs Ban@@ otti to reply to you under the procedural motion .
Madam President , as my dear friend El@@ ly will know , I will do anything to make her and my Dutch colleagues happy .
I would like to assure you as qu@@ a@@ est@@ or in charge of this issue that we have had technical discussions about the various channels on television and radio , and I have already started mailing colleagues in this connection .
If it is of any comfort to her , the Irish have not got their channel yet either .
There seem to be in@@ trac@@ table technical problems but we are definitely working on it .
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this .
I am not so sure that our Dutch Members will be re@@ assured on the grounds that the Irish Members too are unable to receive a national channel .
I think we must do what we can to see that all Members can receive their own national channel .
Thank you , Mrs Ban@@ otti , and also the other qu@@ a@@ est@@ ors for your effort to achieve this .
Madam President , I should like to tell Mr Wur@@ tz that the Commission &apos; s doctr@@ ine is not the Bre@@ zh@@ ne@@ v doctr@@ ine of limited sovereignty and that , until proved otherwise , we are not in the situation where Articles 6 and 7 would be applicable .
Austria , therefore , is perfectly entitled to form its government and the President of the Commission is perfectly entitled , and even duty bound , to offer Austria his best wishes .
Mr Wur@@ tz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party , the French Communist may@@ ors , were sending bul@@ l@@ doz@@ ers against im@@ migrant hostels in France .
Agenda
The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents , pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure .
a ) S@@ itt@@ ings from 14 to 18 February 2000 in Strasbourg Rel@@ ating to Wednesday :
President .
This would then give us , for Wednesday &apos; s sitting , the two Council statements on the coherence of Union policies with development policy and on the UN &apos; Human Rights &apos; sitting , followed by the joint debate on Cyprus and then the reports by Mr Swoboda , Mr Cor@@ ri@@ e , Mrs Fr@@ ass@@ oni and Mr K@@ nör@@ r Bor@@ r@@ à@@ s .
Is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal ?
Since no one wishes to speak , I shall put this proposal to the vote .
( Parliament gave its ass@@ ent ) Rel@@ ating to Thursday :
President .
I have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
On the subject of human rights , I have received two proposals for addi@@ tions : one from the Group of the European Liberal , Democ@@ rat and Reform Party for an item entitled &apos; Cambo@@ dia &apos; and the other from the Group of the Greens , for an item entitled &apos; Pin@@ och@@ et &apos; .
As you know , we can only include five items in the &apos; Human Rights &apos; section .
According to the list given in the final version of the agenda , there are already four items .
We can therefore table only one additional item .
Who wishes to speak on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democ@@ rat and Reform Party to propose the addition of an item on Cambo@@ dia ?
The international community has asked for justification for what is happening in Cambo@@ dia .
After all , we approved the elections in Cambo@@ dia , in what was one of the biggest fi@@ as@@ cos on the electoral observation front .
Only this Parliament has emerged with some of its credit int@@ act .
I think that we , as a Parliament , even now have to assume our responsibility and speak out on the situation in Cambo@@ dia .
( Parliament gave its ass@@ ent ) President .
The item on Cambo@@ dia is therefore added to the &apos; Human Rights &apos; section . This ren@@ ders the proposed item on Pin@@ och@@ et n@@ ull and void .
In addition , I have received some proposals for subjects to be included in the topical and urgent debate .
Here we are not adding any more sub-@@ items under the &apos; Human Rights &apos; heading , we are introducing new items .
In view of the time available given that , as you know , we have a Commission statement on the restructuring of business and that the current list already includes two items , we can only add two additional items .
I shall take the proposal from the Con@@ federal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left first .
( Parliament rejected the proposal )
President .
We will now take the proposal from the Group of the European Liberal , Democ@@ rat and Reform Party .
Is there anyone to speak in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President , it is remarkable that the European Parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of Mr Pin@@ och@@ et , despite the fact that international arrest warran@@ ts have already been issued .
Since the Belgian Government &apos; s appeal to a higher court was declared ad@@ missible last week and since the decision has essentially not yet been taken , it is important for Parliament to at last give out a strong message , a message which should signi@@ fy that nobody can escape a just trial .
It is in@@ concei@@ vable that the European Parliament , which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights , should fail to adopt a clear stance on this .
Madam President , this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time .
Firstly , the European Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of General Pin@@ och@@ et , but , furthermore , there are certain questions to be borne in mind .
The first is that this matter is su@@ b judi@@ ce in several European countries , and I would like to remind Members that there is still no European judicial area nor a European legal system .
We are in favour of the International Criminal Court , but it does not yet exist .
Secondly , there is currently a democratically elected government in Chile , led by Ric@@ ardo N@@ ú@@ ñ@@ ez , whose first declaration was that all those who have committed this type of crime must face justice , and I would remind you that the Chi@@ lean justice system , which is independent , is currently examining 60 complaints lo@@ dged against General Pin@@ och@@ et , concerning his crimes against humanity .
I believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up , but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure .
We believe that justice should be done in this case , but this is not the most appropriate procedure .
( Parliament rejected the proposal ) President .
We now come to the third proposal which is for &apos; Environmental disasters in the waters of the Danube &apos; , a proposal tabled by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance .
Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , what has occurred in a tri@@ but@@ ary of the Danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the Cher@@ nobyl disaster .
It affects not only Romania , but also Yugoslavia and , in fact , the entire Danube basin .
We consider the matter to be important enough for the Commission to react swif@@ tly to this situation , and I think that Parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject .
( Parliament gave its ass@@ ent ) President .
Still relating to Thursday &apos; s sitting , the PPE Group has requested that Mrs C@@ eder@@ schi@@ ö@@ ld &apos; s report on increasing protection by pen@@ al sanctions against counter@@ fei@@ ting in connection with the introduction of the euro should be brought forward to Wednesday as the last item on the agenda .
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President , the agenda has been re@@ arranged so many times that I would simply ask the Chamber to support the present proposal .
It is not a very time-@@ consum@@ ing matter , but it is extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delays .
It is in fact about protecting the euro against counter@@ fei@@ ting , which is an extremely urgent matter .
We have tried to drive this proposal through . I should therefore be very grateful indeed if the Chamber could support it .
( Parliament gave its ass@@ ent )
Rel@@ ating to Friday : President .
Rel@@ ating to Friday , on Friday morning we have an oral question on postal services and the Group of the Party of European Socialists is requesting that the motions for resolutions should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in Brussels , as envisaged in the final version of the draft agenda .
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PSE Group in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President , with ap@@ ologies to my friend , En@@ ri@@ que Barón Crespo , I should like to speak against this proposal .
I am surprised it has even been made , because we came to an agreement following an exchange in the Conference of Presidents .
I think that your proposal , Madam President , to keep the debate and the vote separate , with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date , is a reasonable one . The reason is as follows : this issue concerns no less than 1 800 000 employees within the European Union .
We already have a directive . It is not an old one , it was issued in 1997 .
D@@ eci@@ ding upon future policy lines , with a view to a new directive , rather has@@ ti@@ ly , without having had time to consult the trade unions or have discussions with all the social partners , I feel , runs counter to the spirit we wish to in@@ ject into the debate on matters which directly involve the social operators .
I propose , therefore , that we should keep the arrangements as per the agenda , with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date .
Madam President , I clearly owe Mr Wur@@ tz an explanation , and I am going give this explanation before the whole House .
We had reached this agreement on principle in the Conference of Presidents .
At the time , I did not know that Commissioner Bolkestein was going to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter .
My group has debated this matter and considers that , given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and dereg@@ ulation in such a sensitive area , it is appropriate that Parliament makes an initial statement , regardless of any action it may take in the future , so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week &apos; s debate .
Madam President , I should simply like to ask Mr Wur@@ tz to take a second look at what this is about .
It has nothing to do with any disputes on the substance ; it is just about the following question : when will the Commission - having already had a year and a half to do this - finally be in a position to table the directive ?
Our sole intention in tab@@ ling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adher@@ ed to , and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible .
That is why I should like to support the Social Democrats &apos; request to hold the vote on Friday .
( Parliament gave its ass@@ ent )
Madam President , as you know the C@@ eder@@ schi@@ ö@@ ld report has been taken off Thursday &apos; s agenda .
That ought to mean that we have more time on Thursday .
Since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate , in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half , I simply wanted to ask whether the ses@@ sional services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time .
In general the way in which si@@ tt@@ ings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very cha@@ otic .
Last Thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote .
On Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda .
That is absolutely absurd .
I really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which si@@ tt@@ ings are managed .
This sounds perfectly feasible .
We shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour , considering the withdrawal of Mrs C@@ eder@@ schi@@ ö@@ ld &apos; s report .
This is all I am talking about here , just that .
Madam President , I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday , which you have not yet announced .
I understand that there is no argument about the fact that the Council declaration , on the next sitting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights , is not going to include the declaration on the 50@@ th anniversary of the Geneva Conven@@ tions , and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part-session in March , so that it may be delivered in a sol@@ em@@ n and formal way .
I understand that there is agreement on this issue .
Madam President , this afternoon , in this Chamber , reference was made to a series of reports on the BBC Today programme this morning , which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lob@@ b@@ ying companies or somehow mis@@ using their position as Members of this House .
These are serious alleg@@ ations .
They are completely un@@ true , mal@@ icious , politically bi@@ ased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their fal@@ seh@@ ood .
We are taking legal advice . My colleagues &apos; register of interests is complete .
If we find that any Member of this House or their employees collabor@@ ated with the BBC in this far@@ ra@@ go we will ex@@ pose them to the op@@ prob@@ ri@@ um of this House .
Quite , we agree absolutely .

Sustain@@ able urban development - rural development - E@@ QU@@ AL initiative
The next item is the joint debate on the four following reports :
Report ( A5-00@@ 28 / 2000 ) by Mr Dec@@ our@@ ri@@ ère , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the Communication from the Commission to the Member States laying down guidelines for a Community initiative concerning trans-European cooperation intended to encourage harmon@@ ious and balanced development of the European territory ( INTER@@ RE@@ G ) ( COM ( 1999 ) 4@@ 79 - C@@ 5 ­ 0@@ 24@@ 3 / 1999 - 1999 / 2@@ 17@@ 8 ( CO@@ S ) ) ;
Report ( A5-00@@ 24 / 2000 ) by Mr Proc@@ acci , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the draft communication from the Commission to the Member States laying down guidelines for the Community initiative for rural development ( LE@@ AD@@ ER + ) ( COM ( 1999 ) 4@@ 75 - C@@ 5 ­ 0@@ 25@@ 9 / 1999 - 1999 / 2@@ 18@@ 5 ( CO@@ S ) ) ;
Report ( A5-00@@ 34 / 2000 ) by Mr St@@ enz@@ el , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the draft communication from the Commission to the Member States establishing the guidelines for Community Initiative Programm@@ es ( CI@@ Ps ) for which the Member States are invited to submit proposals for support under the E@@ QU@@ AL initiative ( COM ( 1999 ) 4@@ 76 - C5-0@@ 2@@ 60 / 1999 - 1999 / 2@@ 18@@ 6 ( CO@@ S ) )
Since Mrs McCar@@ thy &apos; s flight has been delayed slightly , I propose that we hear from Mr Dec@@ our@@ ri@@ ère first .
. ( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioners and members of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I was given the task of drawing up the European Parliament &apos; s report on the Community Initiative Programme INTER@@ RE@@ G III .
Upon refer@@ ral to committee , we examined over a hundred amendments and , so far , 17 amendments , some of which have already been presented in committee , have once again been tabled .
Before discussing the content of the resolution , I should like to inform you of the elements which I took account of and which guided my work as rapporteur .
First of all , I would like to remind you of the function of the INTER@@ RE@@ G Community initiative , founded on the principle of trans@@ nationality and innovation .
This programme constitutes a driving force for development on the European scale .
INTER@@ RE@@ G is one of the four Community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000-@@ 2006 , and is the one with the largest budget for implementation , i.e. EUR 4.@@ 8@@ 75 billion as opposed to EUR 3.@@ 6@@ 04 billion at the present time .
The INTER@@ RE@@ G initiative , created in 1990 , is built upon the wish to make the regions of Europe ready for a &apos; Europe without fron@@ tiers &apos; in the context of establishing the great single market .
At the time of the reform of the Structural Funds in 1994 and 1996 , the INTER@@ RE@@ G C@@ IP has incorporated new str@@ ands contributing to the development of trans-European transport and energy distribution networks .
These programmes promoted cross-border , transnational and inter@@ regional cooperation within the European Union by encouraging balanced development of the Community area .
The INTER@@ RE@@ G III programme , for which we have before us today the guidelines issued by the European Commission , pursuant to the terms of European Community Regulation No 12@@ 60 de 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds , continues these measures .
It is based on three str@@ and@@ s. strand A organis@@ es cross-border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions , at both internal and external borders of the European Union , on the basis of joint cross-border development strategies which Member States &apos; local and regional authorities are responsible for implement@@ ing@@ . strand B govern@@ s transnational cooperation between national , regional and local authorities in various Member States or applicant countries regarding regional development , transport networks and the environment .
Member States , i.e. national authorities , are responsible for implementing this strand .
Finally , strand C organis@@ es inter@@ regional cooperation between different regions of the Member States or third countries to exchange experience under str@@ ands A and B and cooperate in the fields of research and technological development , subject to consultation with the European Commission which is responsible for its implementation .
The new INTER@@ RE@@ G programme , in the form in which we have received it , takes into consideration the needs en@@ gen@@ dered by enlargement to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and to island regions and most remote regions .
The Commission proposes re@@ distribut@@ ing the INTER@@ RE@@ G funding as follows : between 50 and 80 % for strand A , 6 % for strand C , and the remain@@ der for strand B , i.e. from 14 up to a maximum of 44 % .
The European Commission draws up the list of eligible regions for strand A and strand B. It bases its assessment princip@@ ally on the map of regions eligible during the previous programming period .
The most remote regions may benefit from support under strand B. The Commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand A is not comprehensive , but is comprehensive for strand B. The Commission reserves the option to , at a later date , put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions , for strand C.
The adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on Structural Funds .
Pro@@ pos@@ als are drawn up by Member States and are submitted for approval to the European Commission , which checks their con@@ formity with the general guidelines , adopted .
These proposals must include a number of elements , an overview of the cross-border or transnational priorities and strategies , a description of the measures necessary to their implementation and an indic@@ ative financial plan .
In promoting cross-border , transnational and inter@@ regional cooperation , this cross-@@ disciplinary instrument is the very inc@@ ar@@ nation of a regional policy on the European scale intended to encourage harmon@@ ious and balanced development of the Community territory .
An integrated development policy for all rural areas in the European Union is therefore needed , consisting of the following elements : an integrated , multi-@@ sectoral approach , simplification of administrative procedures , improvement of the partnership between European institutions and national and local actors and protection of the environment .
In its 1998 policy paper , Agenda 2000 , the Commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based : the recognition of the multi@@ functionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for developing rural areas .
The first principle means creating a new &apos; pact &apos; between farmers and society , making the far@@ mer &apos; ste@@ ward of the countryside &apos; and ensuring that society is prepared to pay for the environmental services needed to safeguard the countryside &apos; s recreation value .
The second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector , so that a complete development programme which integr@@ ates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented .
In this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the CAP .
The LE@@ AD@@ ER Community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bot@@ tom@@ -up approach to rural development and to diversi@@ fy measures by adapting them to local needs .
The following objectives were set : improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative ; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector ; dis@@ semin@@ ating this knowledge to other rural areas .
LE@@ AD@@ ER I applied to the rural areas covered by Structural Fund Obj@@ ectives 1 and 5@@ b , and 2@@ 17 local action groups participated in it , with financing of EUR 1 15@@ 5 million .
LE@@ AD@@ ER II ( 199@@ 4-@@ 1999 ) , for which a total evaluation has , unfortunately , not yet been completed , had a wider scope than LE@@ AD@@ ER I : there were probably over 800 beneficiaries and the sums allocated , after real@@ location of resources , probably amoun@@ ted to over EUR 4 000 million .
In October 1999 , following the success of LE@@ AD@@ ER I and LE@@ AD@@ ER II , the Commission decided to extend the initiative .
For the 2000-@@ 2006 period provision has been made , unfortunately , only for a total contribution of EUR 2 0@@ 20 million , and an indic@@ ative allocation for each Member State has been set .
LE@@ AD@@ ER + diff@@ ers from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible . It is also more ambitious , and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet .
I therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because , as I was saying , it emphasises the innovative development strategies and because it is more ambitious , even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qualify as rural more flexible so as not to pen@@ alise rural areas with high or low population den@@ si@@ ties .
I believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skills and for the implementation of joint projects between different areas of the Union and I repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measures already in existence , such as the Car@@ ref@@ ours .
I share the Commission &apos; s preference for the use of global grants while ur@@ ging , however , that the accounting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and pain@@ stak@@ ingly defined .
I regret the delay with which LE@@ AD@@ ER , as was the case with the other three initiatives , was presented to Parliament and for the kno@@ ck-@@ on delay this ent@@ ailed for the whole procedure .
Finally , I am concerned by the pau@@ city of the amount allocated , if you consider , in addition , that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the Union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous LE@@ AD@@ ER II .
I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpf@@ ul@@ ness and cooperation , and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , my report on E@@ QU@@ AL takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative , whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market .
The report was a major undertaking because it also incorpor@@ ates opinions from four further committees - from the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equ@@ al Opport@@ unities , and the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freed@@ oms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
This Community initiative succ@@ eed@@ s the two for@@ er@@ un@@ ner programmes AD@@ A@@ PT and E@@ MP@@ LO@@ Y@@ M@@ ENT and has a much smaller budget of around EUR 2.@@ 8 billion .
The initiative adop@@ ts a completely new approach , which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships .
The intention is clear : targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level , projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employ@@ ability , entrepreneur@@ ship , adap@@ tability and equal opportunities .
This objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this House .
In addition , E@@ QU@@ AL should feed into the National Action Plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these Action Plans .
It is an important Community initiative which , together with the three other initiatives , UR@@ B@@ AN , LE@@ AD@@ ER and INTER@@ RE@@ G , is financed out of the Structural Funds .
In my report I have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships .
I consider technical support to be necessary but , given the problems with the former TA@@ Os , no new TA@@ Os should be set up without Parliament &apos; s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level .
Nevertheless , technical assistance is necessary .
Partic@@ ular attention is also paid to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice , with special emphasis on mainstre@@ aming .
I have endeav@@ oured to secure the wi@@ dest possible support for the report .
This has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises .
A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers .
However , in this context , Madam President , to allow us to work out the details , I should like to request that the vote on the E@@ QU@@ AL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday .
I believe that it is important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the Commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the European Parliament , because Parliament put the appropriations for E@@ QU@@ AL in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that Members &apos; ideas were also reflected in this Community initiative .
In this connection , the European Parliament is also justified in insi@@ sting that it should be possible to amend the them@@ atic priorities only after a further hearing in Parliament .
E@@ QU@@ AL should live up to its name , and this is my firm intention .
It should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union .
It should prevent society from sp@@ lin@@ tering .
It should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life .
Everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age , gender or origin .
That is my intention and I would ask the House to give this report overwhelming support !
Madam President , it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new UR@@ B@@ AN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.@@ 10 p.m. but I am here !
Just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it ax@@ ed the UR@@ B@@ AN initiative .
Yet we as politicians knew that there was a ground@@ s@@ well of support for continuing this initiative into the year 2000 .
Parliament , therefore , can take credit for a successful lob@@ b@@ ying campaign to put UR@@ B@@ AN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-@@ turn .
Ur@@ ban policy has always been at the for@@ efront of EU policy .
In my Member State , for example , we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government t@@ ask@@ force is looking at the problems of urban communities .
With eight out of ten people in Europe living in urban areas , it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of de@@ priv@@ ation , social exclusion , j@@ ob@@ less@@ ness , crime , drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that .
For example , in my own region , in Manchester , the UR@@ B@@ AN Community initiative has been a tremendous success .
UR@@ B@@ AN funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neigh@@ bour@@ h@@ oods in the UK , in Mo@@ ss Si@@ de .
The Millennium Youth Park project is helping to get young people re-@@ engaged in re@@ generating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turn@@ around of a very deprived urban community .
The work of this UR@@ B@@ AN agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and public@@ ity campaign in local super@@ markets and famous British pubs .
This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in terms of communication and public@@ ity .
As regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative , they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity .
We agree that they ought to be indic@@ ative in nature , allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes .
In committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50 .
We are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of 50 is not the key factor .
Instead , we should go for goo@@ d-@@ quality projects that can act as a cat@@ aly@@ st to effect change and renewal , to attract in@@ ward investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multip@@ lier effect .
The Member States should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their al@@ locations .
In the design@@ ation of local UR@@ B@@ AN programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on de@@ priv@@ ation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas .
In the UK the local index of de@@ priv@@ ation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statis@@ tic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes .
This needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the EU criteria .
I would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that .
Our most deprived urban neigh@@ bour@@ h@@ oods face a ple@@ thor@@ a of problems : high unemployment and often very low-@@ paid prec@@ arious employment , poverty and social exclusion .
O@@ ften these problems are compo@@ unded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency .
We therefore have unstable communities which are in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ated with crime , dru@@ g-@@ dealing and gangs .
This is all too familiar in many of our urban areas .
All these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents , yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity .
That is why again , in my report , I have asked that action under the UR@@ B@@ AN Programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem : these areas do not have single , &quot; mon@@ o &quot; problems .
Instead , communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems , using EU resources as a value added to local actions .
I would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti-@@ discrimination , as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty .
The Community initiative means community involvement . Some of the most active and committed prop@@ on@@ ents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents .
We need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes .
The time-@@ scale therefore proposed by the Commission is very ambitious .
It is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation .
The Commission must of course provide full disclos@@ ure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disc@@ lose the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice .
This is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks .
Finally , I should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the post-@@ industrial city we require local participation .
We need to deplo@@ y the energies of the unemployed , the under@@ used skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems .
We shall thereby be able to replace poverty , dependency and alien@@ ation with equity , initiative and participation .
This will help us to restore the credibility of the EU and the confidence of citizens that Europe can deliver local action to solve local problems .
. ( IT ) Mr President , as the rapporteur , Mrs McCar@@ thy , has already pointed out , we can certainly consider UR@@ B@@ AN a success for the European Parliament with regard to the debate held last year on the reform of the regulations .
As we have heard , the objective of UR@@ B@@ AN is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social re@@ generation in urban areas , bearing in mind that 80 % of the population of Europe lives in cities .
Cre@@ ating a functioning urban environment in terms of social policy requires a policy of long-term job creation , action to combat poverty , measures to assist low-@@ income groups and old people , facilities for children , ra@@ cial and ethnic integration , better opportunities for participation , a targeted public health policy including measures to prevent drug abuse and concer@@ ted crime prevention measures .
The Communication from the Commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic , social , and infra@@ structural measures .
However , we must remember that , in addition to UR@@ B@@ AN , a number of other Community instruments are also available in the social sector : innovative actions under Article 6 of the ES@@ F regulation , pilot projects , particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introduced by the European Parliament under the 2000 budget and the E@@ QU@@ AL and INTER@@ RE@@ G initiatives and mainstre@@ am ES@@ F activities .
As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stressed in its opinion , the Commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit syn@@ ergies in this context while avoiding dup@@ lication of multiple funding .
While , on the one hand , we believe that ste@@ ering committees should ensure that the various projects are coherent and complementary , we would on the other hand urge the Commission to reinforce exchanges of information and coordination between the departments involved .
Not only is this coordination essential but , as we stated in our opinion , exchanges and the dis@@ sem@@ ination of expertise and good practice must also be essential .
Mr President , the importance of this initiative is increasing constantly as economic and social problems in Europe &apos; s cities intensi@@ fy and the public feels more and more out of touch with the administration of its city or neighbourhood .
That situation will be compo@@ unded by social rec@@ lassi@@ fications resulting from European Union enlargement , and we must therefore make provision for the economic re@@ generation and social cohesion of our cities .
Ad@@ dres@@ sing those problems is all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of cities into the surrounding areas and in view of the cities &apos; historical and cultural role .
However , in order for such an effort to succeed it is necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to en@@ list the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affected by the economic and social crisis .
Here , we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of women , and the agencies that represent them , in planning and implementing the UR@@ B@@ AN initiative programmes .
As the Committee on Equ@@ al Opport@@ unities , we also stress the need to finance infrastructures that will facilitate professional activity by women , mainly by harmon@@ ising their professional and family commitments , and more generally infrastructures that promote solidarity between the generations , social solidarity .
Eff@@ ective implementation of this initiative could have a cum@@ ulative result because it could insp@@ ire similar action at regional and local levels , thus increasing its political importance still further since women need to feel the effects of European policy in their day-to-@@ day life in real terms .
Mr President , our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the Commission for the UR@@ B@@ AN programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention .
In committee we thought that it was necessary for the economic and social re@@ generation of urban areas to go hand@@ -in-@@ hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities and therefore for measures designed to reduce racism and xenophobia to be an integral part of programmes to be funded by UR@@ B@@ AN .
We considered that increasing public confidence by combating everyday urban crime was one of the central tasks of urban re@@ generation .
Our committee noted that innovative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole array of measures including the incorpor@@ ation of crime prevention in town planning , action to prevent ju@@ ven@@ ile del@@ inqu@@ ency , the re@@ integration of offen@@ ders , and models for effective local cooperation between the various parties involved , for example the police , the courts and social services .
We adopted our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we felt that it was particularly important to continue UR@@ B@@ AN - which in the past has been implemented successfully - because , as we see it , programmes of this kind are the only way in which we in the European Union will succeed in ensuring that in the long term all those who live in the European Union enjoy peaceful co@@ existence .
For this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind .
I should like to comment on the concerns which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has with regard to the largest of the four Community initiatives , INTER@@ RE@@ G III .
It must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under INTER@@ RE@@ G III .
In the light of the fact that 50 % of unemployment in the Union is essentially structural and given the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border regions - I need only refer to the possibility of un@@ welcome migration - this is not only reasonable but imperative .
The measures eligible for funding listed in Annex II of strand A do also seem encouraging in this respect .
In reality , however , the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects .
I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures , especially in areas with high levels of long-term and youth unemployment .
Employment policy measures should also be eligible for funding under strand B , especially for the applicant countries as part of the pre-@@ accession strategy .
In general where the employment policy measures are concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for appoint@@ ments to the joint cooperation committee to be made on a regional basis - because the local expertise required for these specific purposes is only available at regional level - so as to avoid these measures becoming too abstra@@ ct and therefore pro@@ ving disappointing .
The fact that administrative expenditure on INTER@@ RE@@ G III is - in my opinion - still excessive is something which we can and indeed always must critic@@ ise , although it almost seems to me as though this is un@@ avo@@ idable with the Commission &apos; s support programmes .
However , I should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fat@@ al .
It is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simplified as possible so that the social dimension of the EU is once again given the importance which it deserves .
We ask for a guarantee that the decision-making bodies for the projects are represented equally by three elements : political representatives and public administrations , companies and economic operators , and social operators , including unions and non-governmental organisations . We would particularly like to stress that there must be balanced representation between men and women in all of these bodies .
We would also like to stress that the main objective is the promotion of strategies for sustainable development , whose positive effects would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself , and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integrated into the development programmes , included in Obj@@ ectives 1 and 2 , and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are located .
We are pleased that all the rural areas of the Union may be involved in LE@@ AD@@ ER + , but we believe that it is necessary to concentrate Community resources in the less@@ -@@ favoured regions in order to facilitate the process of socio-economic cohesion within the Union , and that state governments should not diver@@ t these resources towards objectives other than cohesion .
The Committee believes that projects financed under action 1 should place value on the potential of end@@ o@@ genous development , in particular based on local traditions , techniques and practices , on specific production and on the management of sustainable energy .
The Committee supports the Commission proposal to concentrate actions in small selected areas and believes that , given the disp@@ er@@ sed nature of many rural inhab@@ ited locations , the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduced to 10 000 inhabitants .
We believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and management mechanisms of actions 2 and 3 , financed by LE@@ AD@@ ER , with those of other actions financed by other Community programmes relating to inter@@ regional and international cooperation and partnership , such as INTER@@ RE@@ G , SA@@ P@@ AR , PH@@ ARE , TAC@@ IS and ME@@ DA , in the same areas .
Mr President , Mrs St@@ enz@@ el , ladies and gentlemen , before addressing the E@@ QU@@ AL report itself , I should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guidelines on which the report is based .
The basic objectives of an EU-@@ wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employ@@ ability , entrepreneur@@ ship and adap@@ tability .
These objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy .
However , the aim of an approach which really sought to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people &apos; s self-@@ determination .
Only then does it stop being a question of economic us@@ ability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives .
Mrs St@@ enz@@ el &apos; s report has , however , turned out very well , at least where the prescri@@ bed guidelines are concerned .
All asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes , although this should be self-@@ evident .
Nevertheless the Conserv@@ atives voted against this in the committee .
I would ask them the following questions : does your policy seek to margin@@ alise people ?
What is the idea behind preventing people from working when they wish to do so ?
Does this not stand in stark contradiction to the gui@@ del@@ ine on employ@@ ability ?
It is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstre@@ aming programme , because there remains a short@@ coming in the report .
Partic@@ ular emphasis is given to the point that women &apos; s opportunities on the labour market ought to be improved and that to achieve this more cr@@ è@@ ches should be built .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism adopted this opinion on the E@@ QU@@ AL report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one ab@@ sten@@ tion .
I am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
This cross-@@ group support for the opinion is explained by the conclusions , which are devoted to the question of how issues related to regional policy , transport and tourism can be combined with action to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market .
That is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure .
The committee based its conclusions on these critical comments .
We attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector , in tourism and in small and medium-sized enterprises with promoting the establishment of new small and medium-sized businesses bearing in mind the necessary economic structural change .
D@@ ov@@ et@@ ailing the activities under the Community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for at@@ taining the objectives of the E@@ QU@@ AL programme .
We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the E@@ QU@@ AL programme .
The specific target of deri@@ ving European added value brings the regional cooperation up to European level while re@@ taining the cooperation of the various regional operators .
This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it has already been mentioned today that the first UR@@ B@@ AN initiative was an un@@ qualified success .
A new feature of the UR@@ B@@ AN II initiative is that it has been tailored to small cities or parts of cities .
This is important because it is precisely small cities which often find it harder to access aid .
And yet the problems which give rise to the urgent need for re@@ generation can be particularly acute precisely in cities of this kind and thus have a propor@@ tionally adverse effect .
To increase the effectiveness of individual measures the number of projects for UR@@ B@@ AN II has been limited to 50 .
I think that it is important not to stick rigi@@ dly to this arbitrary quantitative restriction and instead to leave it to the Member States to decide between how many projects they each wish to divide the support funds to which they are entitled .
In any case it is necessary to ensure that in small Member States in particular it is not only areas of large cities which are again in receipt of the support .
There UR@@ B@@ AN II would only be a drop in the ocean ; its success would be doub@@ t@@ ful and the whole thing would be a fl@@ op .
Just as important in my view is not to bro@@ aden the selection criteria for UR@@ B@@ AN II too much and thus water them down .
It is precisely a strictly defined list of criteria which is essential if the programmes which are funded are to be models and be transfer@@ able to other problem cities in the future .
From my own experience of local government in an old industri@@ alised region bes@@ et with problems , I should like , in conclusion , to ask for your particular support , ladies and gentlemen , for two points in the report which alongside the social policy aspects are , I believe , essential .
Firstly , environmental protection is essential for sustainable urban development and the inclusion of this aspect should therefore be a general requirement for a project to receive funding .
Secondly , preventing and combating routine urban crime and crime related to drug dealing must start at local level .
These are essential steps towards increasing the quality of urban life and must therefore also play a central role in the UR@@ B@@ AN II initiative .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteurs , who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time .
However , criticism has been voic@@ ed within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee .
The reports are late , and , in addition , they were very has@@ ti@@ ly discussed by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
A good opportunity to discuss the results , good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost .
Our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTER@@ RE@@ G programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the European Union .
Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region , but , in my opinion , we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either .
Our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTER@@ RE@@ G , TAC@@ IS , IS@@ PA and PH@@ ARE programmes .
This coordination is at present lacking , and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it .
We here in Parliament are waiting for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible .
It is of decisive importance to get local business , organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes .
Experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful .
Pro@@ jects have often remained half-@@ finished , and their efficiency has been dra@@ ined by administration and bureaucracy .
We also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement .
Our group is re@@ viewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee .
I would like to mention here again the UR@@ B@@ AN report , in which the rapporteur , in the explanatory statements , has dealt admir@@ ably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabit@@ ant as per the Commission &apos; s guidelines .
It will not work as an automatic target , but must be applied in the target area according to prev@@ ailing conditions .
This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , INTER@@ RE@@ G is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds .
Here , projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support ; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries .
Unfortunately this is only true for part of the money , that is only for the borders within the EU .
But it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation .
The regulation pret@@ ends that there is one , but there is not .
The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years , although Parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time .
The practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be down@@ gra@@ ded .
Since 1996 , Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties .
Nothing has happened !
The difficulties are once again being allowed to pers@@ ist , to the detriment of the regions concerned .
Parliament is here rene@@ wing its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation , and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other Commissioners .
We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of pap@@ er-@@ pus@@ h@@ ers !
Mr President , a third of EU money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes .
According to my group , this is excellent if , as a result of this , de@@ priv@@ ation within regions , towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved .
That is a question of solidarity and progress .
But dish@@ ing out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending .
The local coun@@ cils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience .
They find it is extremely difficult to spend the money on their most need@@ y causes .
Any@@ thing related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly , but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval .
Since there is great uncertainty surrounding the way in which rules are interpreted , local coun@@ cils and regions have now started to en@@ list the services of expensive bure@@ aux .
The task of these experts is to gau@@ ge to what extent European Commission officials would be prepared to approve plans .
In some cases , I get the impression that it is not about solidarity or allevi@@ ating the most desper@@ ate problems , but about propaganda and uph@@ ol@@ ding v@@ ested interests in exchange for the European Union &apos; s bl@@ essing .
It seems that the key goal there has become the construction and painting of propaganda panels advertising the fact that such and such a project has been co-@@ financed by the European Union .
Too much money is wast@@ ed on propaganda and investigation bure@@ aux , consultation and control , and a great deal of money ends up back in the country where it was collected in the first place .
After the planned accession of new Member States with their 100 million inhabitants , the prosperity level of which is at one third or two thirds of the average level of the current EU Member States , this squ@@ ander@@ ing will generate even more protest .
In the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , the Con@@ federal Group of the European United Left was in agreement with the dra@@ ftsman of the opinion , Mr No@@ gu@@ eira Rom@@ án , on LE@@ AD@@ ER . He was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas .
If there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or inj@@ ecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas , we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality .
After all , innovation in areas that have already grown prosperous is paying divi@@ den@@ ds even now and taking place without European funding .
A second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of ne@@ po@@ tism and abuse of power within regional and local coun@@ cils .
The emphasis is on local groups in which the authorities , non-@@ profit@@ -@@ making organisations and profit@@ -@@ making companies join forces .
The discussion has cent@@ red on the allocation formula to be applied .
In this respect , one of the vari@@ ants considered is remin@@ is@@ cent of the Dutch pol@@ der model , the struc@@ tur@@ ally planned cooperation between government , trade unions and employers &apos; organisations .
Let us not forget that elections for local coun@@ cils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population .
So , really , these bodies should already provide for a balance , and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process .
My group welcomes the fact that the union movement and environmental movement are expressly given their own roles to play , as their input in society is important in our view .
This could prevent local governments that are functioning in a short-@@ si@@ ghted or in@@ sufficiently democratic way from negl@@ ecting their duty of input from the very start .
But the fact that we now fear abuse of power and ne@@ po@@ tism indicates that , unfortunately , democracy is not fully functioning yet .
One of the objections is that , due to the restricted role of the elected bodies , businesses gain more influence .
As long as the economy does not wei@@ gh up the needs of all in a democratic way but is more concerned with making a profit for the benefit of a few , it is question@@ able as to whether democracy functions better under the rule of employers than under the rule of local coun@@ cils .
We believe in &apos; one man , one vote &apos; more than &apos; one share , one vote &apos; .
Mr President , there are economic fron@@ tiers within the European Union , and the internal market with the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital is fully operating at this time .
But for the internal market to work effectively and for the single European currency to be a success it is important that all regions within Europe , of which there are over 100 , can economically compete within this very challenging environment .
Some areas within the European Union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita .
There are poor regions within the Union which need to be given European assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the European Union structure .
That is why , when we look at the EU Financial Per@@ spective between 1989 and 1993 , and 1994 and 1999 , we find such a large proportion of the EU budget was put aside for the administration of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund .
There are twin problems that still remain for many regions in Europe : firstly , the lack of adequate infrastructure in terms of road , water treatment facilities and related transport networks ; secondly , the need to put in place initiatives to combat youth and long-term unemployment , which is a constant social problem in many urban and rural parts of Europe .
There must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a Europe of the cities alone . We need to ensure that job creation initiatives are in place to promote employment opportunities in the small@@ - and medium-sized enterprise sector in rural parts of Europe as well .
The core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programmes , namely , the new INTER@@ RE@@ G III initiative , E@@ QU@@ AL and the LE@@ AD@@ ER + scheme .
Between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the EU to promoting cross-border development , combating the problems of long-term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes .
Mr President , quite a few towns and cities within the European Union have to cont@@ end with de@@ priv@@ ation .
The Member States do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this de@@ priv@@ ation adequately .
This is why it is useful for the European Union to continue to support the Member States and , if necessary , give additional support under UR@@ B@@ AN .
Over the next seven years , the Commission &apos; s proposals concerning UR@@ B@@ AN will ent@@ ail a reduction in both the Community budget and the number of areas standing to benefit .
In common with Mrs McCar@@ thy , I have to note that the number of areas has been dras@@ tically reduced .
It is desirable for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the con@@ fines of a certain budget .
As far as the budget is concerned , as already stated , UR@@ B@@ AN is there to support and complement national policy .
In order to generate extra means if necessary , I think it is entirely logical to turn first to the Member States and private investors .
Consequently , we cannot support Amendment No 2 of the Greens , as borne out in the committee meeting .
In addition , I am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood , especially where Community contributions are concerned , should incen@@ tiv@@ ise .
Structural support is said to cause subsi@@ d@@ y-@@ dependence .
We would then be over@@ reaching ourselves .
I would like to finish off by making a general comment on INTER@@ RE@@ G .
In my opinion , funding for cross-border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions .
When projects are implemented , it is also important that they do not contra@@ ven@@ e general Community legislation .
According to the report issued by the Court of Auditors on the year 1998 , this is not an imag@@ ined risk .
Hence our amendment in order to prevent contradic@@ tions between general policy and actual projects .
Before I begin I will take the liberty of expressing my const@@ ern@@ ation at the way in which Austria has been pre@@ judged by 14 Council representatives .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as part of the reform of the Structural Funds the Community initiatives are being p@@ run@@ ed to a total of four .
I welcome the continuation of INTER@@ RE@@ G and the priority which it has been accord@@ ed .
However , the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems .
The regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines , although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the Structural Funds .
There is no direct transition between INTER@@ RE@@ G II and III , the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding .
That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects .
When INTER@@ RE@@ G is implemented , it will need to be coordinated and synchron@@ ised with the other financial instruments concerned .
This is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds deployed .
However , problems will arise in particular from the fact that under PH@@ ARE , for example , funds are managed on an annual basis and allocation of appropriations is proj@@ ec@@ t-@@ related , whereas INTER@@ RE@@ G funds are multi@@ annual and are allocated on a measur@@ es-@@ related basis .
This will cause practical problems in the future , and I hope that despite this it will be possible to implement INTER@@ RE@@ G effectively .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Community initiative LE@@ AD@@ ER proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas .
The preservation of this Community initiative in particular , in the form of a new version - LE@@ AD@@ ER + - is therefore greatly to be welcomed .
The new LE@@ AD@@ ER + programme now covers all rural areas in the European Union , which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects .
It is important for there to be coordination between LE@@ AD@@ ER + and the other support initiatives in the European Union , but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important .
O@@ verl@@ ap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any syn@@ erg@@ istic effects .
In this context the aim of step@@ ping up networking between eligible zones under LE@@ AD@@ ER is very welcome .
Agriculture is one of the cornerst@@ ones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LE@@ AD@@ ER initiative . In the same way , through the LE@@ AD@@ ER initiative , structural change in agriculture can be supported by creating new jobs in rural areas .
At@@ tention must be paid in the LE@@ AD@@ ER + programme to all the sectors of the economy in rural areas ; only a combined effort will re@@ ap an optimal result .
LE@@ AD@@ ER must now move into the implementation phase .
The operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the Commission , which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible .
Five months are provided for this .
That seems to me to be rather too long .
E@@ f@@ forts should be made here to achieve shorter times .
Because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible .
Despite all the delight over the re@@ working of this Community initiative LE@@ AD@@ ER + , I do still have one further concern . In its proposal the Commission called for an observ@@ atory for the LE@@ AD@@ ER + programme without going into detail on how this proposal would be implemented .
For me this raises the following questions : who will work there ?
How will these people be selected ?
Where , above all , will the required money come from , and where should this observ@@ atory be located ?
I do think , though , that the LE@@ AD@@ ER + programme has not got a p@@ enny to spare on additional administrative tasks , which in the normal course of events would have to be carried out by the Commission in any case .
In addition , experience from other fields where observ@@ atories have been set up shows that , apart from rather du@@ bi@@ ously creating jobs , they are not of any great benefit .
I would therefore call on the Commission to fulfil its monitoring duties directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that LE@@ AD@@ ER + programmes run smoothly .
Ass@@ ess@@ ment and publication are part of this , and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past .
Mr President , the majority of the borders , which have divided Europe for centuries , were arti@@ fici@@ ally created , separ@@ ating single geographi@@ c spaces and creating serious disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion .
Our internal borders , or what remains of them , no longer cause wars , but they do continue to generate economic back@@ war@@ dness , social barriers and a lack of cultural communication between the peoples of Europe .
The Community &apos; s institutions are obliged to work towards over@@ coming these border s@@ cars , which contradi@@ ct the spirit of European unity .
The economic and social cohesion which we propose is based , by means of the INTER@@ RE@@ G initiative , on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border areas and the outermost regions of our continent .
INTER@@ RE@@ G has always been at the heart of a genuine Community policy for regional planning and a truly poly@@ cent@@ ric notion of our European territory .
Although the European Parliament supports this initiative , our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of INTER@@ RE@@ G II .
However , we are aware that we must not delay this third version further , since otherwise we would be jeop@@ ardis@@ ing the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently under@@ way . The success of INTER@@ RE@@ G is clear and that is the opinion of the local , regional and national authorities which have participated in the co@@ financed projects .
The people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together , of innovation , of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and toler@@ ating each other .
There are many interesting questions relating to it , the monitoring centre , the principle of concentration etc . However , I would like to concentrate on the management bodies .
We must create joint , inter@@ regional and transnational management bodies , in which all local and regional authorities , as well as economic and social operators , play an active role .
There must not be any re@@ petition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border .
We must create a cross-border culture , and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation , imagin@@ atively over@@ coming existing barriers and over@@ coming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each Member State , in each region and each municipality .
A project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication .
During debates in committee , we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating INTER@@ RE@@ G with other annual or bi@@ annual financial instruments , such as ME@@ DA , TAC@@ IS or PH@@ ARE .
This Parliament &apos; s motion for a resolution has been very attentive to these difficulties , making proposals capable of solving them to the Commission and setting reasonable deadlines for making the necessary changes .
Mr President , my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the UR@@ B@@ AN initiative , in Ireland in particular , has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area .
It is a sad fact that there are many hundreds , if not thousands , of communities in the European Union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage .
Even in Member States and cities that are extremely weal@@ thy we have large numbers of people living in gh@@ et@@ tos , in situations where there are inadequate facilities , where school@@ ing is very poor , where the physical infrastructure is under-@@ developed and where drugs and other phenomena are ri@@ fe .
It seems to me that in order for the European Union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the European Union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstrate that the Union works for these citizens and their families .
The programme has been extremely successful in Ireland , as indeed I know it has been successful in other countries .
It was quite slow in getting off the ground there , but it was slow because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes .
It is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative .
It would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the UR@@ B@@ AN programme .
I should like to make one further point before I conclude : we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious UR@@ B@@ AN development policy .
This , unfortunately , is not the case in Ireland .
I appl@@ aud the innovative approach of the E@@ QU@@ AL programme and the aim of integrating discrimin@@ ated groups into the labour market .
The development partnerships are a very cle@@ ver idea , even though they are experimental .
I have two major concerns , however , about the development partnerships .
They should be accessible to smaller groups , accessible for them to be able to de@@ vise , implement and monitor the programmes .
We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme .
I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jar@@ gon , so that it becomes accessible to everyone .
I am glad to see that this was accepted into the report , but I cannot agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all .
My second concern was that some discrimin@@ ated groups have specific problems , for example , disabled people &apos; s access to the workplace .
Pro@@ jects should also specifically address this problem . These concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes .
I certainly intend to do that with organisations and groups in my constituency in the West Mid@@ lands .
I now turn to the controversial issue of asyl@@ um-@@ seekers and refugees .
Although I am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with re@@ patri@@ ation , having access to E@@ QU@@ AL , I would support the possibility of access for all other asyl@@ um-@@ seekers and refugees .
It is only fair and right for them to be able to access E@@ QU@@ AL in the same way as everyone else .
Thank you , Mr President .
Ladies and gentlemen , with the LE@@ AD@@ ER report , rural development is very much to the fore .
This does not happen all that often and it is grati@@ fying , especially as the LE@@ AD@@ ER programmes have been key elements in the Union &apos; s rural development policy .
It must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instru@@ mental in struc@@ turing regional planning , but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as , for example , areas experiencing dep@@ op@@ ulation .
It must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the LE@@ AD@@ ER programme , local operators have combined forces , debated and prepared projects .
These programmes have , therefore , been important channels for particip@@ ative democracy , the r@@ ationale of the citizen for Europe .
So , the concept for LE@@ AD@@ ER + should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes .
One urgent question is therefore raised : why , when this programme has been successfully run for ten years , is LE@@ AD@@ ER + still class@@ ed as experimental ?
Are there so many other European schemes which can bo@@ ast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful ?
For how much longer is the Commission going to leave LE@@ AD@@ ER at the experimental stage instead of bringing it online as part of the general concept of mainstre@@ aming of rural development ?
Moreover , I wonder at the reduced guidelines to which the Commission wishes to restrict LE@@ AD@@ ER + .
At a time when , Commissioner , after Seattle , we Europeans are fighting on the grounds of multi@@ functionality in rural development projects , why should we con@@ fine ourselves to a few limited criteria with resources that are far from sufficient ?
As an ec@@ ologist , let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversi@@ fied and man@@ y-@@ si@@ ded approaches .
In this connection , the Commission is proposing to limit yet further the cooperation actions of local action groups to only candidate countries .
A better solution would be , as indeed the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism suggests , strengthened coordination between LE@@ AD@@ ER + and the Community cooperation and partnership programmes , such as INTER@@ RE@@ G , PH@@ ARE , SA@@ PAR@@ D or ME@@ DA .
The fact is , showing solidarity with Eastern Europe , is all very well , but it is not enough .
The tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south , particularly the countries around the Mediterranean , must not be abandoned .
Therefore , once more , we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision . Co@@ decision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type , which require cooperation and cross-@@ disciplinary application .
Mr President , I have a few very brief comments .
We are debating the planning phase and guidelines for the four Community initiatives without access to any substan@@ tive and complete app@@ ra@@ is@@ al of the previous period .
This is not very good at all .
Programm@@ es and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory , while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mis@@ management and even fraud .
The Community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain pre@@ conditions .
They must , however , not be sub@@ ordin@@ ated to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy , but must develop their own self-@@ sufficient role .
For example , adapting E@@ QU@@ AL to the objectives of employ@@ ability and the flexi@@ bili@@ sation of labour relations trans@@ forms this initiative into a new version of local employment contracts .
Ex@@ t@@ ending the LE@@ AD@@ ER initiative to every area in the Union entails the risk of margin@@ alising deprived areas even more , to the benefit of more developed areas .
The INTER@@ RE@@ G initiative must include eligible areas with special emphasis on border areas , islands and both mountain and non-@@ mountain areas , such as the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Ar@@ ta in Greece , whose om@@ is@@ sion from Annex I of the Commission &apos; s communication is ill-@@ considered .
Mr President , rural development has been identified by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area , and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible , Commissioner Fischler .
Our response to rural decline has come late in the day , but I sup@@ pose better late than never .
Family farming is now recognised as central to the European agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed , certainly within the time-@@ scale of Agenda 2000 .
In my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of margin@@ al family farms .
It beh@@ o@@ ves all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival .
As the Commissioner knows , farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities .
For this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of imp@@ acting positively on rural development .
In this regard LE@@ AD@@ ER has established itself as an effective development initiative .
It provides the opportunity for local communities to identify their development potential and become actively involved in addressing those problems .
The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated .
Yet , through LE@@ AD@@ ER , there can be no doub@@ ting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy .
In conclusion , while welcoming Commission approval for LE@@ AD@@ ER + , I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LE@@ AD@@ ER II and the comm@@ en@@ cement of the new programme .
I urge you to look seriously at this problem .
A break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a dis@@ rup@@ tive effect on voluntary and professional workers .
I should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exagger@@ ated tendency which , in the Commission communication with reference to INTER@@ RE@@ G III and III B , involves associ@@ ating environmental protection exclusively with the development of Natura 2000 , which I think is often an exc@@ essively abstra@@ ct means of safeguarding eco@@ systems , from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted .
Finally , if the Commission and the relevant Coun@@ cils of Ministers permit , I should like to stress that the Members of the European Parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the INTER@@ RE@@ G projects and , beyond that , of similar initiatives .
It would be even better if they were involved to a greater extent in the processes of fr@@ aming and implementing the programmes concerned , otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authorities and even the citizens .
Mr President , first of all , I would like thank the rapporteur of the E@@ QU@@ AL report , Mrs St@@ enz@@ el , very warmly for all the efforts she has made to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of us .
E@@ QU@@ AL is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light , doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds .
This is an ar@@ du@@ ous task .
Only , the number of people affected by these programmes has not really dropped .
This is why it is so hard to strike a balance , not only between the different countries or the different components , but especially between the different groups listed in the programme , and in fact this is what has pre@@ occupied us to date .
Comm@@ ents are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another .
I , for my part , have focused on the position of the handic@@ apped and the elderly within the framework of the programme , and I have to say that their position could well have been over@@ looked altogether if it had not been for the European Parliament de@@ voting special attention to them .
Although a few other groups have been mentioned , it is the Member States , in particular , which are on the lo@@ ok@@ out .
For example , I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component , namely refugees .
I would , therefore , ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups .
It should not be the case that one Member State , under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle , can decide that all funding should go to one group .
I think that this will have to be monitored closely because otherwise we will end up in that situation against which Mr Mei@@ j@@ er has warned us so veh@@ em@@ ently , to wi@@ t , that v@@ ested interests will emerge and that people will think that the money is thei@@ rs to spend .
This is not the case !
It has to be re@@ distributed time and again . It should be used for innovative projects and it should not completely disappear into the Finance Minister &apos; s treas@@ ury funds .
That is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here .
I believe that the remaining problems that we have faced within this Parliament , and which in large part stem from the fact that it is so difficult to strike the right balance , can be solved .
As far as the Commission is concerned , I hope it will be able to join in the compromise that is being concluded here in this Parliament , mainly with a view to reaching a balance .
I would just like to underline this - the situation is , of course , a little prec@@ arious - Parliament has , for the sake of convenience and safety , placed the E@@ QU@@ AL programme on the back bur@@ ner for the time being , so that Parliament has yet to be persu@@ aded of the way the funds are to be distributed .
I believe that this is actually a good thing .
The position of Parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear .
The Rules of Procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back bur@@ ner is extremely useful .
Mr President , there is no doubt that the INTER@@ RE@@ G initiative promotes efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union .
However , I should like to stress INTER@@ RE@@ G &apos; s particular importance for the Balkan area , where political developments and hosti@@ li@@ ties over the past few years have had major economic repercussions for neighbouring countries and especially for my own country , Greece , which is the only Member State on that long-@@ suffering peninsula .
For Greece , for the neighbouring countries Italy and Austria , but also for Europe as a whole , the social and economic restoration of the Balkans , bringing political stability , is a vit@@ ally important matter .
So far , some Balkan countries have received aid from the PH@@ ARE and Ob@@ nov@@ a programmes , while others have not .
During the new programme period , in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instruments and regulations , such as IS@@ PA and S@@ ap@@ ard , it is considered absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three str@@ ands of INTER@@ RE@@ G with other financial aid to third countries .
Accordingly , we welcome the related references in Chapter 7 of the European Commission &apos; s proposed general guidelines for INTER@@ RE@@ G .
The efforts to coordinate the planning and so make it more effective must extend to all the programmes equally , and I say that because in the ME@@ DA programme during the last period some problems aro@@ se which have to be overcome , so that we can have equal treatment for all the third countries participating in that programme .
I should like to end by saying that the planning of the new inter-@@ state cooperation zones has taken no account of the Mediterranean &apos; s geographical pec@@ uli@@ arities , which would justify the creation of a special zone for coastal and island regions .
We therefore ask the Commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next comes up for review .
I end by stres@@ sing the need for the European Union to pers@@ ist with such initiatives , which strive to eliminate inequalities between our regions , and to foster their harmon@@ ious development .
And since this is St. Val@@ ent@@ ine &apos; s day , as a former Mayor of a regional city , I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European regions which need that love .
Mr President , Commissioner Fischler , rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different ang@@ les : preservation of jobs , ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship of the countryside and , not least , local culture , because that is of the utmost importance .
Only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured .
We can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the Alps and they are devastating .
But I war@@ n against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside .
And neither should we create structures which are reli@@ ant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them for@@ ever@@ more .
To really guarantee sustainability - a bu@@ zz@@ word which has , since it gained new currency , become relatively de@@ void of meaning , but we all know what we mean by it - what is needed , amongst other things , is an integrated approach in the countryside towards , for example , tourism and agriculture .
The investment needs to be vision@@ ary .
Young , creative individuals must be made to feel an attach@@ ment to the countryside .
If they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more .
None of us think much of the principle of in@@ discrimin@@ ate , all-@@ round distribution , and the pilot projects need to act , as it were , like av@@ al@@ an@@ ches and trigger other similar projects .
I would be in favour of supporting self-@@ contained cycles of projects and , even though LE@@ AD@@ ER I and LE@@ AD@@ ER II may have had shortcomings here and there , overall they were certainly positive .
I should like to ask that we consider granting derog@@ ations not only in the Nordic countries but also for mountain@@ ous areas - the Alps , the Pyren@@ ees and the Sierra Nevada , from where I have just returned - in respect of population size and density .
Mr President , I want to talk about the E@@ QU@@ AL report , especially the issue of the policy on refugees .
Last week , we had a very imp@@ as@@ sion@@ ed discussion about the formation of the Austrian Government .
Today , we are already discussing the Austrian coalition government &apos; s policy on refugees because Mrs St@@ enz@@ el , who is the author of the E@@ QU@@ AL report , of course represents Austria &apos; s governing conservative party and its policy .
The most star@@ t@@ ling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the Geneva Convention , that is to say so-called quota refugees or UN refugees .
In actual fact , it is the other refugees , namely those outside the quota and those not covered by UN aid , who need aid the most .
The Committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the E@@ QU@@ AL programme on identical conditions .
Some members of the Committee , however , supported Mrs St@@ enz@@ el &apos; s proposal and wor@@ dings .
As I see it , this means that Mr Hai@@ der &apos; s politics are already casting their shadow over this Parliament .
It is therefore cru@@ cially important that the Chamber should be as em@@ ph@@ atic as it possibly can be in establishing the fact that all refugees are to have a place on the E@@ QU@@ AL programme .
I want , finally , to say that I had certain mis@@ gi@@ v@@ ings last week when we discussed the formation of the Austrian Government but , when it comes to discussing and critic@@ ising its policy on refugees , I have no mis@@ gi@@ v@@ ings .
I hope that the Chamber will be just as committed this time .
Mr President , during the last EU Financial Per@@ spective from 1994 to 1999 , when there were 13 different initiatives in operation , the INTER@@ RE@@ G II cross-border programme was an important initiative .
The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-@@ 2006 includes the INTER@@ RE@@ G initiative is I believe , a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States .
The INTER@@ RE@@ G I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTER@@ RE@@ G II programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of bri@@ dging closer social and economic development between bor@@ dering Member States .
Com@@ ing from the border coun@@ ties in the north-@@ west of Ireland , I have seen over the years the important role which INTER@@ RE@@ G I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTER@@ RE@@ G III .
The Commission is al@@ loc@@ ating 67 million po@@ unds towards the INTER@@ RE@@ G III programme , which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
The European Union has played a key role in developing the border county region in Ireland over the years .
The European Union is the single largest contribut@@ or , with 80 million po@@ unds to the International Fund for Ireland . The European Union contributes 75 % of the Peace and Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation programme .
All in all , INTER@@ RE@@ G , the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process .
Mr President , I am taking the floor to speak about INTER@@ RE@@ G , but I shall con@@ fine myself to a few criticisms , which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time .
We have all spoken favour@@ ably of this programme &apos; s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and inter@@ regional cooperation , in addition to cross-border cooperation .
However , this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50-@@ 80 % - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation , for INTER@@ RE@@ G II@@ IA . Therefore , we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand , regarding the selection of eligible regions , is wrong and contradic@@ tory .
We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament &apos; s position in practical terms , and not just with a formal tribute .
Cross@@ -@@ border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning land@@ locked areas and , where exceptions have been made for maritime areas , their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies .
This discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature .
This is in line with ongoing discrimination , which ign@@ ores Article 15@@ 8 of the Treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies .
More serious still is the fact that this is occurring while ign@@ oring the new situation associated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of regions such as Malta .
This has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the N@@ UT@@ S III S@@ ic@@ ili@@ an provin@@ ces which have a fron@@ tier with Malta and to include all the regions of the Adriatic which share a fron@@ tier with Balkan regions .
For a long time , probably a survival of our colonial heritage , our regions have fixed their attention on the European main@@ land , ign@@ oring and even sc@@ or@@ ning their closest neighbours .
That time is now past .
Our regions have become aware of belonging to an environment that they are connected to , not only in geographical terms but also in terms of their culture and the history of their peoples , hence the inten@@ sely expressed aspir@@ ation to become more deeply rooted in this environment .
This increased awareness does not , however , affect identity alone .
It is fo@@ stered by a fair app@@ ra@@ is@@ al of our assets .
So , for example , the island of Ré@@ union is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern Africa and those of south-@@ east Asia .
It cannot afford to remain outside the regional alli@@ ances being for@@ ged in this area , l@@ est it miss out on a historic opportunity , and the same applies to our regions in the Caribbean .
At last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment , the source of so much des@@ pair , if we can export to neighbouring countries the know-how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the European structural funds .
INTER@@ RE@@ G appropriations may be used to make our regions into ver@@ itable European Union bri@@ d@@ geh@@ e@@ ads into these geographical areas , giving it worldwide scope .
I am counting on the Commission , and specifically on you , Commissioner , to al@@ locate adequate resources for effective action .
Mr President , Commissioners , I greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation under INTER@@ RE@@ G , but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas .
I understand the Commission &apos; s own concern that distance may prove detri@@ mental to effective cooperation .
Nonetheless , there are many maritime areas between which links are already established .
Various local authorities around the North Sea provide a prime example of this .
INTER@@ RE@@ G could well allow enh@@ ancement of such cooperation .
In consequence , I seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand A and strand B. These adjustments include clari@@ fying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and per@@ mitting greater development of practical and visible projects , particularly those of an infra@@ structural kind .
Such measures will put maritime and ins@@ ular areas on an equal footing with other areas of the EU . I hope for their adoption .
Mr President , our group welcomes the horizontal thr@@ ust of the E@@ QU@@ AL initiative so that , if you are a British Muslim physi@@ cally disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group : you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems , rather than being defined as the problem .
There is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared .
We also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dis@@ sem@@ ination of best practice for the tigh@@ tening up of the transnational level .
We are concerned , therefore , as others have said , at the number of amendments which seek to exclude even further some of society &apos; s most excluded , by aiming for a very narrow definition of &quot; refugee &quot; .
My group will not be supporting those amendments .
We are also concerned at the number of amendments which , in seeking to introduce greater flexibility , run the risk perhaps of obs@@ cur@@ ing responsibility for the management of the E@@ QU@@ AL initiative .
Mr President , I am very pleased to see UR@@ B@@ AN orient@@ ated towards a more integrated approach which attempts to solve inter@@ related problems .
Yet , there is some risk of di@@ lu@@ tion of effort . If we pursue too many objectives , our overall effectiveness suff@@ ers .
Of course , every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case .
But there is a common factor , a hard core , comprising unemployment , the resign@@ ation or withdrawal of public services and the dis@@ appearance of small and medium-sized enterprises , both commercial and other kinds .
I would wish UR@@ B@@ AN to be orient@@ ated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban de@@ priv@@ ation .
For this , of course , central policy must inter@@ act and be coordinated with development policy , so that the latter too can be re@@ orient@@ ated and can work syn@@ erg@@ is@@ tically with the objectives of any UR@@ B@@ AN programmes implemented in our countries , and so that it is not just using them as an ali@@ bi for its own shortcomings .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I shall con@@ fine my observations to Mr Dec@@ our@@ ri@@ ère &apos; s report .
The INTER@@ RE@@ G Community Initiative Programme is an extremely important tool in terms of the development and regional planning of European territory , most particularly with reference to effectively taking into account the relationship between the centre of the European Union and its out@@ lying regions .
INTER@@ RE@@ G must , therefore , be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a tw@@ o@@ - or even three-@@ speed European territory .
It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities , and their representative bodies , the Committee of the Regi@@ ons and , of course , the European Parliament should have been involved in the clear@@ est way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity fr@@ aming this programme .
Indeed , I am forced to observe that this was not the case when the Commission drew up its communication , published on 13 October last year .
Even though I approve of the general guidelines of INTER@@ RE@@ G III , I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme , financed by the ER@@ DF , and the other external cooperation funds , including in particular the European Development Fund , intended for ACP countries .
In this connection , I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the ED@@ F to the list of these funds .
The most remote regions , particularly the four French overseas departments , must be able to coordinate INTER@@ RE@@ G III and the ED@@ F in order to fund , in turn , cooperation projects with their ACP neighbours in their respective geographical areas .
Furthermore , I would ask the Commission to please re@@ consider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication .
It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTER@@ RE@@ G III , just like all the other regions in the Union , especially now that the RE@@ G@@ IS programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped .
Finally , in conclusion , I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand C , for inter@@ regional cooperation , even though the added value this offers the Community is unden@@ i@@ able .
Mr President , my starting point is the E@@ QU@@ AL report and equality between men and women , although I must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue , which has a feeling of dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u about it when you are my age , in any case .
Unfortunately , it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality .
A break@@ through in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas , however .
For me , equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a marriage work the whole time and hand the children over to a n@@ ann@@ y , ali@@ as an im@@ migrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job .
If that is the case , we have not progres@@ sed one little bit since pag@@ an times .
No , equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life .
Unfortunately , developments are not moving in that direction .
On the contrary .
I think , therefore , that paragraph 7 contains something very central , i.e. that E@@ QU@@ AL will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies .
One can only hope that it succ@@ eed@@ s .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , those who work on rural areas know that , of the programmes which the European Union has managed , the LE@@ AD@@ ER programme , both LE@@ AD@@ ER I and LE@@ AD@@ ER II , is one of its success stories , and I hope that the same will be true of LE@@ AD@@ ER + .
One of the reasons why it has been so successful is that the basic concept of the LE@@ AD@@ ER programmes ar@@ ous@@ ed substantial interest in activities amongst the population concerned .
I am glad that LE@@ AD@@ ER + is to remain true to this underlying concept .
There is a problem , however , which we need to address together .
Because LE@@ AD@@ ER is a kind of workshop with a bot@@ tom@@ -up approach , a huge number of ideas have come to fru@@ ition in recent years through LE@@ AD@@ ER I and II which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once were .
And because of the programme &apos; s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be dropped from LE@@ AD@@ ER .
That is why , where the good LE@@ AD@@ ER projects are concerned , we need to ensure that those which have proved to be outstanding are not suddenly dis@@ continued ; instead the ideas which have proved to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transferred into the standard programmes as a reliable , positive component of our support to rural areas .
Of course this is also the basic idea .
It is to take new ideas and try them out in LE@@ AD@@ ER , with the participants on the ground , with the local organisations on the ground , with many non-governmental organisations , with the churches , with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities .
Here we must ensure that the good schemes , those which are really excellent , are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this lau@@ dable work .
My request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted .
There should be no attempt to have one or other organisation , which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known , pushed a little on to the si@@ delines , say because of official local or regional policy .
Have faith in the successful results which LE@@ AD@@ ER has had so far .
At the beginning it is sometimes a little like ch@@ asing a rain@@ bow if we say that a plan is too ide@@ alistic .
And then when the work and the action start something emerg@@ es which the official policy , including ourselves at this level , could never have imag@@ ined would suddenly have developed so well .
That was the charm of LE@@ AD@@ ER , and that should please not be lost !
Mr President , I welcome the E@@ QU@@ AL initiative and the report which highlights the need to distinguish between actions to combat discrimination against women and actions to combat discrimination against minority groups .
Women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender .
This is why specific action for women is needed , as well as mainstre@@ aming .
The report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work ; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstre@@ amed .
The involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ing@@ re@@ dient of the E@@ QU@@ AL initiative and the projects .
The development partnerships within the them@@ atic fields , which are referred to in Amendment No. 22 , would enable even the smaller organisations to play a part in the E@@ QU@@ AL initiative .
My group will be supporting Amendment No. 22 .
Mr President , the report under discussion in the House today is doub@@ tless of great importance .
In addition to the objectives it is working towards , the strong point of the Community initiative INTER@@ RE@@ G for the 2000-@@ 2006 programming period lies in its added value from the view@@ point of what is now the im@@ min@@ ent enlargement of the European Union to include new Eastern European and Mediterranean countries .
In my opinion , it is precisely in anticip@@ ation of this deadline that the European Union should strive to reduce disparities between regions and put an end to the isolation of border areas .
Indeed , these areas - and it is right to stress this - have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the Union .
It is precisely with this in mind that I tabled some amendments which I consider to be of the utmost importance , and that the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism has subsequently taken up .
They call for the areas eligible for cross-border cooperation to be extended to all regions of the Adriatic , as well as to the S@@ ic@@ ili@@ an provin@@ ces which have a fron@@ tier with Malta - an applicant country - which , in@@ explic@@ ably , are not currently included in strand A , Annex 1 .
I am confident that Commissioner Barnier and the President of the European Commission will duly consider Parliament &apos; s position on the matter , in accordance with the Code of Con@@ duc@@ t .
There are fundamental advantages for the whole of Europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions .
Finally , it is to be hoped that greater coordination will be sought between the INTER@@ RE@@ G initiative and the existing Community programmes , which are significant for external policy , as a v@@ ector for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programmes .
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , LE@@ AD@@ ER I was an ou@@ tri@@ ght success due , in particular , to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operators .
It is , I think , regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of LE@@ AD@@ ER II , regarding the quality of the projects , the quantity of appropriations spent and , most especially , the demo@@ tiv@@ ation of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial un@@ wi@@ el@@ din@@ ess they encountered .
I am pleased to see , however , that under LE@@ AD@@ ER + , new resources have been allocated to helping rural territories to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development .
I feel it is important to put special emphasis on trying out new ways to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment , in order to promote employment .
The time is now right , I think , to consider including the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation .
It is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for LE@@ AD@@ ER II .
Nonetheless , if the opportunity for Member States to determine the areas , within the scope of this initiative , remains available , then the Commission will have to ensure a certain focusing of resources and priori@@ tise projects in the less prosperous areas .
There must , of course , be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups .
I also feel there are grounds for ensuring , in particular , that the financial channels of States or local authorities are not behind the delays in payment which may have caused some LA@@ G@@ s to become bank@@ rupt under LE@@ AD@@ ER II .
Mr President , as a Member from one of the outermost regions , I must point out that this is a very special afternoon as far as regional policy is concerned , because of the debate on two Community initiatives , UR@@ B@@ AN and INTER@@ RE@@ G .
I would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed , firstly , in the case of UR@@ B@@ AN , at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various European cities , and , in the case of INTER@@ RE@@ G , at facilitating cohesion and recognis@@ ing the diversity and potential of the regions of the European Union , particularly by including the outermost regions in str@@ ands B and C.
Like the rapporteur , we depl@@ ore the fact that it has been excluded from strand II@@ IA .
With regard to INTER@@ RE@@ G , we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a European monitoring centre concerned with cooperation .
I would like to thank the rapporteurs , particularly Mr Dec@@ our@@ ri@@ ère , for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments .
I hope that the Commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making .
Mr President , with regard to the various initiatives which we are analy@@ sing this afternoon , I would like to concentrate strictly on one of them , that is , the UR@@ B@@ AN programme .
It is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the European Parliament insi@@ sted that this initiative should be maintained .
The Commission proposed removing it and other initiatives , but Parliament &apos; s proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time led to the UR@@ B@@ AN initiative being retained .
I believe that we should be pleased about this .
But what were the Commission &apos; s arguments , from Commissioner Mon@@ ika W@@ ul@@ f-@@ Ma@@ th@@ ies and Director@@ -@@ General E@@ ne@@ ko Land@@ ab@@ ur@@ u in particular , for eliminating the UR@@ B@@ AN programme ?
Its argument was one of priority .
The urban question is so important that we cannot tigh@@ ten our bel@@ ts and under@@ value it with a programme which has such a small budget .
Today the programme is in place and therefore I believe we have achieved something important , that distingu@@ ishing mark of the European Union called the UR@@ B@@ AN programme .
However , I would like to address Commissioner Barnier and support the argument of Commissioner W@@ ul@@ f-@@ Ma@@ th@@ ies and the Director@@ -@@ General , because I think they were absolutely right .
The urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds .
Therefore , I do not believe I need to rest@@ ate the number of factors which demand this investment in urban areas , factors which are on the agenda , and I would like to say to the Commissioner that we hope he will be sensitive in this respect .
In welcoming the cross-@@ sectoral approach em@@ bo@@ died in the new E@@ QU@@ AL initiative , it is crucial that the programme addresses the distinct forms of discrimination which milit@@ ate against disabled people in particular : physical barriers in the workplace affecting those with limited mobility , visual information systems which exclude blind workers , working systems which effectively close the door on people with learning difficulties or with mental health problems .
Organis@@ ations of disabled people and disabled people &apos; s non-@@ disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision-making .
That is why this Parliament has put forward paragraphs 10 and 15 of the resolution , to ensure that Member States cannot ignore any one target group .
Disabled people have too often been left off the list .
Because disabled people do not form one homo@@ genous group - for example many de@@ af people see themselves as a linguistic minority denied respect for their own language and culture - it is necessary as stated in paragraph 9 to enable some partnerships to be defined which are specific to a particular disability or other group .
E@@ QU@@ AL remains crucial also to regions like my own , in the east of England , outside the principal funds of Objective I. We have had an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response .
For@@ mer AD@@ A@@ PT projects range from the CO@@ RE project , which has developed new supply chains for the car industry in Bed@@ for@@ d@@ shire , to projects to raise standards in small businesses in Her@@ t@@ for@@ d@@ shire in Ess@@ ex .
We have seen the NO@@ W project helping 70 women to return to work in Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k , many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the European Parliament in Brussels .
E@@ QU@@ AL remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower@@ -@@ skilled jobs are being shed , which can be an important first destination for those discrimin@@ ated against in the labour market .
Finally , a word on INTER@@ RE@@ G .
It really is quite non@@ sensi@@ cal that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter-@@ regional links .
During this period the ports of Great Y@@ arm@@ outh and Har@@ wich on the Ess@@ ex-@@ Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k-@@ Nor@@ folk coast have launched significant new transportation and economic links with partners in the Netherlands .
I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2 , which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas , particularly on maritime borders .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , for the information of the House , Mr President , I should like to make a clarification .
Chancellor Sch@@ üssel &apos; s government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government led by Chancellor Klima .
There is no change in refugee policy in Austria !
Rural areas make up over 80 % of the EU &apos; s territory and 25 % of the population live in them .
As a far@@ mer and Member of Parliament , I have always endeav@@ oured not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural areas as a whole .
I attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because I am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone ; I refer , in short , to the multi@@ functionality of rural areas .
I should like to welcome in particular the new LE@@ AD@@ ER + programme because of its comprehensive nature .
In the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the EU .
This acro@@ ss@@ -@@ the-@@ board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way .
In the future , funding will no longer come from three funds but from the E@@ AG@@ G@@ F Gu@@ idance section alone .
It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the E@@ AG@@ G@@ F is supposed to be an effective financial instrument .
Gre@@ ater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness , because the money should not be squ@@ ander@@ ed reck@@ lessly .
In addition , I should particularly like to emphasise the point which offers an approach towards creating an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy .
There is great potential for future job creation in rural areas here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospects to people living in the countryside .
That is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers .
LE@@ AD@@ ER + should supplement already existing programmes , avoid overl@@ aps and dup@@ lication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which is as comprehensive as possible .
In this way , LE@@ AD@@ ER + can , together with the programmes under Regulation ( EC ) No 12@@ 57 / 99 , consolidate the second pillar of the CAP even more effectively and produce the best possible benefits for the whole of the countryside .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am not always proud of the f@@ uss that goes on here in Parliament , but the UR@@ B@@ AN programme is one of the best examples of our work : it was created following an initiative in Parliament .
The Commission would have abolished UR@@ B@@ AN , but this time Parliament drew the longer stra@@ w .
It is good that UR@@ B@@ AN is to continue , as it has had good results at local level .
The problems in Europe &apos; s urban areas are getting worse ; fortunately , we now have consensus with the Commission .
The majority of the population of Europe live in cities , and their problems are among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matters in themselves .
There is an immense risk of exclusion .
In many cities in France and England there are now sl@@ ums , breeding grounds for many sorts of problems .
None of us wants South American type fav@@ el@@ as in Europe .
We have to act now , before it is too late .
Our cities are also of decisive importance for Europe &apos; s economy .
We always come back to the same basic problem in Europe : our economy does not support the individual sufficiently , nor is it sufficiently dynamic .
The economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fel@@ low-@@ citizens and our environment .
This is not policy ; it is life &apos; s simple logic .
It is good that spending has become focused , as otherwise the bu@@ ck@@ shot gets sc@@ attered to the four winds .
Now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ size towns and cities , as they do not have enough resources .
In this way we will also be able to speed up matters in surrounding rural areas ; it is often forgotten that urban and rural problems in fact go hand in hand .
The basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneur@@ ship , as group action begun by the individual will help re@@ vit@@ alise an area internally .
Gran@@ ting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two feet is like carrying water to fill up a dry well : there will be enough to drink for a while , but tomorrow the well will be dry again .
Mr President , with the implementation of INTER@@ RE@@ G III , European cooperation policy is entering a new phase .
Our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones .
In the context of globalisation and cultural openness which character@@ ise the current situation , the European Union needs instruments that will allow it to strengthen its links and communication channels with neighbouring regions , particularly in Eastern and Southern Europe .
The Union &apos; s borders must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development , but - on the contrary - an opportunity , a bridge to more fruit@@ ful cooperation .
By means of amendments adopted in committee , Parliament has tried to supplement the Commission &apos; s work , by including new elements in the list of areas targeted for aid , and in particular external border areas and maritime border areas in Southern Europe .
In its draft guidelines , the Commission acknowled@@ ges that these borders require greater attention than they did in the past . This is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the Mediterranean countries .
As President Prodi too mentioned when out@@ lining the strategic objectives for the period 2000-@@ 2005 , boo@@ sting the Barcelona process is a priority for the Union , and the INTER@@ RE@@ G III initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective .
Mr President , from this year until the year 2006 around EUR 200 billion is available for the Structural Funds , but only 5 ¾ % is set aside for the Community initiatives , INTER@@ RE@@ G , LE@@ AD@@ ER , UR@@ B@@ AN and E@@ QU@@ AL .
That is a reduction of 3 ¾ % compared with the previous C@@ Is .
No more than EUR 2.@@ 8 billion is provided for E@@ QU@@ AL , as Mrs St@@ enz@@ el &apos; s balanced report makes clear .
This makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more aston@@ ishing .
How are priorities supposed to be set here ?
There is agreement on the principle that margin@@ alisation , discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced .
Trans@@ national strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs .
I have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the TA@@ Os .
Cri@@ ticism of the previous Commission &apos; s work was particularly severe , legitim@@ ately so , with regard to these Technical Assi@@ stance Off@@ ices .
Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was , after all , in overall charge of analy@@ sing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to LE@@ ON@@ AR@@ DO .
The Commission cannot therefore be rel@@ iev@@ ed of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under E@@ QU@@ AL either .
The Commission must therefore be the guarant@@ or of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work , of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices .
Only then will it be possible for the desired multip@@ lier effect to be achieved .
Mr President , I want to refer to the Commission proposals on the budget line to promote the CAP .
On 26 October 1999 the European Commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line inform@@ ing the public about the CAP .
This proposal will remove the current budget line B@@ 2-@@ 5@@ 12@@ 2 and create a new budget heading B@@ 1-@@ 3@@ 82 .
Ac@@ tions which promote understanding between young farmers and the EU and also create stronger links with EU candidate countries and the outside world are important .
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme .
Given the need to encourage young farmers to continue in farming it is vit@@ ally important that they are well-@@ informed about developments in the common agricultural policy .
Inform@@ ing and training young farmers at European level is vit@@ ally important .
I would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst European young farmers .
Regarding information and training , in the past this budget line has been allocated for information , communication and training .
But the Commission is now proposing that training should no longer be included . I feel that training should be included where it provides relevant information at European level about the CAP .
Such European training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the CAP to make sound business decisions for the future .
Therefore I am putting forward three amendments .
I would urge Parliament to support them .
Mr President , I am taking the floor to express my opinion , drawn from my experience of municipal administration , that the UR@@ B@@ AN projects should , or rather must , have a thre@@ ef@@ old purpose : firstly , to promote the restoration of infrastructure and historic , old and perhaps di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated areas of cities .
Secondly , to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres , within these old quarters of our cities .
There is little point in having streets which are now wonder@@ fully lit , with new p@@ av@@ ements , with newly p@@ aved road surfaces , all wh@@ it@@ e@@ wash@@ ed and beautiful , if we are not able to fill them with activity and , therefore , employment .
I would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators , but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment , or to put it another way , projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs .
Thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the projects should princip@@ ally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families , because man is not made for the law , but rather law is made for man .
These areas of our cities are often home to single-@@ parent families , elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity , and families facing difficulties ; sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstre@@ am society .
These people live in areas which should benefit from these projects .
If we have success in this thre@@ ef@@ old sense , I believe that these families , these people , these European citizens , will believe more in Europe , and this seems to me to be very important because , ultimately , the cities will increasingly come to play a leading role in European life .
. ( FR ) Mr President , before my friends and fellow Commissioners , Franz Fischler and Anna Diam@@ ant@@ op@@ oul@@ ou , in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four Community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest , I would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of UR@@ B@@ AN and INTER@@ RE@@ G , which many of you have brought up and discussed .
Stra@@ i@@ ght away I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteurs from the committees , from all the committees , but also to the speakers for the groups and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speeches and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiatives .
This is particularly true of what Mrs McCar@@ thy said about UR@@ B@@ AN . I should like to thank her not only for her work and for the report which she presented but also - and I do not see why I in turn should not say so too - for all we owe her , for all you owe her as far as this is initiative , as well as , more generally , all we owe Parliament .
I am min@@ d@@ ful of the fact that it was in fact the European Parliament which made the political decision and supported the continuation of this initiative for the re@@ generation of urban areas in difficulties , in favour of sustainable urban development , involving at the same time this integrated approach , which we value , to handle the economic , social and environmental aspects simultaneously .
Having mentioned the fundamental points of agreement between the Commission &apos; s proposals and Parliament and , having stressed my great interest in hearing the various contributions , I should like to answer a few of the criticisms and a few of the suggestions which have been made , with ap@@ ologies if I cannot attri@@ bute each of the questions to the speakers by name .
I think however that you will all recognise your own comments .
Firstly on the subject of the UR@@ B@@ AN programme and the maximum threshold of fif@@ ty towns , which a number of you ter@@ med arbitrary .
I can understand your concern .
That is my initial response to the threshold question .
Regarding a second matter , now , relating to the additional criteria , which should be taken into consideration in selecting disadvantaged areas . Here , too , I am willing to demonstrate greater flexibility and to consider other relevant criteria in addition to the Community criteria given in point 11 of the guidance project .
Third point : specific measures in favour of some social groups - some speakers mentioned them - women , but also immigrants and refugees , must be envisaged .
This concern , ladies and gentlemen , lies at the very heart of our UR@@ B@@ AN initiative , and I am willing to re@@ write the text , if necessary , in order to make this message clearer yet .
Regarding UR@@ B@@ AN , I should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention , first of all , the selection procedure .
Some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic , more transparent , and to avoid redund@@ ancy in terms of the projects and funding .
Ladies and gentlemen , on this point we must make it clear : in the context of subsidiarity , the selection of zones or municip@@ alities eligible for UR@@ B@@ AN is primarily the responsibility of the Member States .
As far as the Commission is concerned , it is willing to avoid any un@@ justified bureaucratic over@@ load , but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes , indeed you would be the first to critic@@ ise us if we did .
A second observation , the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes .
I have no obj@@ ection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme .
This cannot , however , be grounds for an extension of the original time limit .
Let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months .
This time limit , which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTER@@ RE@@ G and for the Objective 2 DO@@ C@@ U@@ Ps , should normally be adequate , I feel , for drawing up a programme , which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage .
With regard to UR@@ B@@ AN , I should like to conclude with a final observation .
One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the UR@@ B@@ AN initiative .
I agree completely .
But , as for the future , since we must look ahead , I am extremely concerned to see how UR@@ B@@ AN is going to be implemented in practical terms , and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn , because pl@@ ain@@ ly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be , for future financial perspectives , a new European regional planning policy .
I am not for@@ getting , and we cannot forget , that 80 % of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this UR@@ B@@ AN instrument is extremely important .
Let me repeat what I have said , we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming .
I should now , Mr President , like to bring up the subject of INTER@@ RE@@ G and to thank the rapporteur , Franc@@ is Dec@@ our@@ ri@@ ère , in the same way that I than@@ ked Ar@@ l@@ ene McCar@@ thy , for the quality and relevance of his work .
Having made these general observations , I should like to focus on your main comments with regard to INTER@@ RE@@ G .
The first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative .
You comment that these guidelines were adopted at too late a date , stres@@ sing , particularly your rapporteur , the risk that the previous programmes will be interrupted .
It is true , I admit it , and you are well aware of the reasons , ladies and gentlemen .
There is a delay in adopting the INTER@@ RE@@ G guidelines in March or April 2000 .
I accept this ; I take note of it as you do .
I note , however , that the Member States and the regions are already actively preparing the programmes for INTER@@ RE@@ G III and indeed the guidance project was distributed over three months ago now .
I also note that eligi@@ bility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available retro@@ actively back to 1 January , if the programme is presented before 30 April .
So much for the first comment .
As to the second comment : regarding the non-@@ comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand B , I wish to inform you , to confirm , that I have asked the Commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects , particularly in favour of small@@ - and medium-sized businesses and of cultural heritage , in the list of schemes eligible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one .
Third point : inter@@ regional cooperation , the importance of strand C. The Commission shares the observations made by this House regarding the importance of strand C , inter@@ regional cooperation .
As your rapporteur has requested , I shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand .
Four@@ th observation : the European Ob@@ serv@@ atory and the possible use of a technical assistance office .
As you requested , I have decided to remove all references to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the Commission on the service out@@ sourcing systems .
Now to the implementation of INTER@@ RE@@ G , a subject mentioned by many of you , and the potential eligi@@ bility under strand A , &apos; cross-border cooperation &apos; , of schemes in the Adriatic , on behalf of S@@ ici@@ ly or for the most remote regions , the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , understands your concerns and takes note of your requests on these various points .
I therefore intend to amend the guidelines in order to incorporate a specific priority into the transnational strand B : &apos; integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions &apos; , so as to cover , in what I think is an appropriate fashion the various opportunities for cooperation between these regions .
I have decided , in the end , that the most remote regions , to which I attach particular importance , will be given special priority in the context of the transnational strand of INTER@@ RE@@ G , with a cooperation strategy which will aim at improving their links with their neighbours and other Member State regions .
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTER@@ RE@@ G and the ED@@ F , particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean .
All this should make it possible for us , apart from the Objective 1 appropriations and also with them , to confirm the role of &apos; active fron@@ tier &apos; of the Union .
I adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote regions of the Union are actually active fron@@ tiers of the Union , even if , or precisely because , they are remote and located in other regions of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear .
Another point : the coordination between INTER@@ RE@@ G , PH@@ ARE , TAC@@ IS and ME@@ DA .
It is true , once again , and I accept this obj@@ ectively , that there are still real legal problems .
I do not want to minim@@ ise these , but progress is being made as far as strand A cooperation with candidate countries is concerned , even if the problems related to the management procedures and to the scale of the projects still remain .
The Commission must continue along these lines .
I am making a personal commitment to do so .
An initial joint PH@@ ARE / C@@ IP committee is to meet in February to assess this coordination , and let me confirm my atten@@ tiveness and availability with regard to this , together with my colleagues and fellow Commissioners Verheugen , Patten and P@@ oul Niel@@ son .
Finally , on the subject of technical assistance , on which your rapporteur and several of you comm@@ ented .
It goes without saying that the Commission will adhere to the terms of Article 23 of the general regulations regarding technical assistance , if it is indeed assistance intended to be an instrument useful to structural policy in general .
According to the general regulations , however , any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a Community initiative must be proposed under Article 20 , and not Article 23 .
This means that the ceiling of 0.@@ 25 % mentioned in Article 23 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance .
I attach great importance , ladies and gentlemen , in a spirit of discipline and transparency , to our nonetheless re@@ taining some financial str@@ ands for matters relating to the exchange of experience and information , and not to propaganda , and to the implementation of networks ensuring good communication of best practice within the Union .
My conclusion regarding INTER@@ RE@@ G , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , is that these Community initiatives for which I am responsible fulfil a real need and everything that has been said is proof of this .
They also fores@@ ha@@ dow a real European regional planning policy within our enlarged Union .
The Commission att@@ aches the greatest importance to this , just as you y@@ ourselves do .
I remain at your service in order , when the time comes , to present the report of previous planning which you request , but also to keep you informed regularly as to the implementation of these initiatives in the course of the new planning .
Rep@@ eating my thanks to each and every one of you , and also particularly to Ar@@ l@@ ene McCar@@ thy and Franc@@ is Dec@@ our@@ ri@@ ère , I should like to point out that these two initiatives lie within a financial framework with which you are familiar : only EUR 700 million for UR@@ B@@ AN , but this is better than nothing ; EUR 4 billion 800 millions for INTER@@ RE@@ G .
So we are working within this framework and not outside it .
On the subject of these two initiatives , then , with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives , let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and its committees .
Everything that I have just said , ladies and gentlemen , demonstrates that the Commission is resolved to taken the views of Parliament into account .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like firstly to thank Mr Proc@@ acci for his report .
However , I should also like to extend thanks to the various committees involved and Parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have given the LE@@ AD@@ ER + initiative .
This initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original ideas , ideas which it is then intended should at a later stage be incorporated in the general programmes as models .
I am also pleased that Parliament essentially supports the Commission &apos; s view that LE@@ AD@@ ER + should be applied in all rural areas , that over@@ riding priorities should be introduced and that , above all , active cooperation and networking between rural areas should be encouraged .
In addition , I note that Parliament shares the Commission &apos; s view that the preferred form for implementing LE@@ AD@@ ER + is the use of global grants .
Tur@@ ning now to some of the individual questions raised here today , I can also confirm that we wish to have the wi@@ dest possible partnership and participation in LE@@ AD@@ ER + .
The various groups , be they environmental organisations or groups concerned with employment , have the possibility of taking part in drafting the Commission directives .
And there will not be less funds available than in the current period either ; there will be more .
I should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observ@@ atory is nothing new .
There was also an observ@@ atory under LE@@ AD@@ ER I and LE@@ AD@@ ER II .
It has one purpose only and that is precisely to maintain active networking between the individual LE@@ AD@@ ER groups .
The cost of this observ@@ atory is not permitted to exceed 2 % of the LE@@ AD@@ ER budget .
As far as the possibility of having projects containing training initiatives is concerned , I might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integrated into the new rural development policy , which means , in our view , that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of LE@@ AD@@ ER .
I now come to the content of the report .
In point 14 , Parliament calls on the Commission to submit an evaluation report on LE@@ AD@@ ER II immediately .
I should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because , as you know , it is still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 2001 - for LE@@ AD@@ ER II funds to be dis@@ bur@@ sed .
We therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme &apos; s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation .
We will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it .
In point 18 , Parliament suggests publishing a comp@@ endi@@ um of examples of successful initiatives .
In response I can only say that this already exists .
It has already been compiled by the Commission and I can make a copy available to any Member of this House who is interested .
In point 21 , Parliament stresses that the guidelines in LE@@ AD@@ ER + now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start .
I can only fully share your concern .
As soon as the opinion is adopted here in Parliament , the guidelines for LE@@ AD@@ ER + will again be presented to the ST@@ AR Committee so that the Member States can confirm the pro@@ visi@@ onal agreement which they gave on 14 November .
I assume that the Commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guidelines in March or April .
And as soon as these are published in the Official Journal the remaining months - in fact six months - can be used to submit LE@@ AD@@ ER + programmes .
I believe that it is important to point out one thing : expenditure eff@@ ected under LE@@ AD@@ ER + is eligible from the time that the Commission programme starts running .
For all programmes submitted before 30 April of this year it will be possible to back@@ date the beginning of the period of eligi@@ bility to 1 January .
Finally , under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines .
Having given them thorough consideration , I can tell you that the proposals made under paragraphs 2 , 4 , 5 and 7 are acceptable to the Commission and are adopted .
The proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffir@@ ms that the time allowed for appro@@ ving programmes under LE@@ AD@@ ER + is a maximum of 5 months .
The amendment proposed under paragraph 1 has , in our view , been over@@ taken by events because , following consultations with the representatives of the Member States in the ST@@ AR Committee , this point has already been re@@ wor@@ ded along the lines proposed by Parliament .
That therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3 . The Commission can only endorse this request because of course it corresponds precisely to what the Commission itself had originally proposed .
I must add , however , that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the Member States .
An amendment was therefore made in the committee , but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament &apos; s concern in the revised version and table the guidelines in that form .
It will also continue to fight for Member States &apos; acceptance of this .
I will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled .
Here there are only three which the Commission cannot accept , Amendments Nos 3 , 12 and 13 . It can accept all of the others either in full or in essence .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is an exceptionally fortunate circum@@ stance that we are debating the E@@ QU@@ AL initiative in the European Parliament just at this time .
Recently , because of political developments in Austria , there is growing un@@ ease within Europe . Political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue .
It is worth stres@@ sing that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policies .
We need specific proposals , both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies .
So I will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committees to appoint their rapporteurs so that we can move ahead with the anti-@@ discrimination package as soon as possible .
I now come to the E@@ QU@@ AL initiative , which is , of course , based on Article 13 .
The E@@ QU@@ AL initiative relates to all forms of discrimination within the meaning of Article 13 , namely the fight against discrimination based on race , gender , age , and special needs .
I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs St@@ enz@@ el , because her effort to reach agreement on the E@@ QU@@ AL initiative has proved exceptionally difficult and complex , both because some of the committees involved view the issue in a different light and because it is a very sensitive political issue .
The first comment , which has been made by many others too , is whether women should be mentioned separately .
I agree that Article 13 contains something we have expressed our dis@@ agreement about , but that is how the Treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination , discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place .
So on the basis of the Treaty as it stands today , the E@@ QU@@ AL initiative is structured in that way .
I would like to remind you , however , that there is a special axis for the employment strategy which relates to women and that a special programme is being prepared , the fifth programme for equality between men and women .
I have classified the issues raised by the honourable Members into four groups .
Firstly , the enlargement of the them@@ atic areas .
As in employment strategy , there are four them@@ atic areas : employ@@ ability , entrepreneur@@ ship , adap@@ tability and equal opportunities , and we agree that those them@@ atic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament &apos; s proposals .
To answer the concern whether there is a risk that a country might concentrate all the funds on one of the categories suffering discrimination , I will say that the initiative states clearly that the Member States must submit one them@@ atic category for each group that is suffering discrimination .
The second subject is flexibility and simplification .
I agree with Mr L@@ einen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand .
That is why the services are already trying to re@@ vise the text , simplify its structure and make its wording easier to gr@@ asp .
As regards the subject of flexibility , we propose development partnerships and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kinds of groups would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace , and at the them@@ atic level where , for example , cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector .
This would allow Member States great flexibility to tail@@ or development cooperation to their own particular needs .
Of course , a prerequisite for that is cooperation between the Member States , and a network which will assist the exchange of experience .
Finally , I would like to mention technical assistance .
We are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available . First , funding for preparation ; second , implementation ; third , mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience , and fourth , technical assistance .
Since there has been great involvement and concern about how technical assistance is to be provided , we must say that external offices will be used .
As Mr Barnier too pointed out , it is impossible for all the work previously done by external collabor@@ ators to be done now by the Commission &apos; s staff .
The aim at national and European level is to establish large action groups by tender , with a full description of the project for which external assistance is to be requested . We would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitored and app@@ raised .
I want to stress that it is extremely important to promote this specific initiative as quickly as possible , both for reasons of political timing and because we believe that it is important that it should begin as planned , in other words , we must be absolutely ready by the end of 2000 .
Thank you , Commissioner .
I shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the Bureau and to the appropriate committees .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon .
( The sitting was closed at 8.@@ 40 p.m. )
Appro@@ val of the Minutes of the two previous si@@ tt@@ ings
The Minutes of the si@@ tt@@ ings of Thursday 3 February and Monday 14 February have been distributed .
The Minutes of 3 February were originally distributed in Brussels so perhaps this is why some Members did not receive them .
Are there any comments ?
( The Minutes were approved )
Madam President , my hab@@ it is always to be here for the opening of the part-session on Monday after@@ no@@ ons at 5.00 p.m.
Yesterday it was impossible for myself and many MEPs to be here , because the 2.@@ 15 p.m. Air France flight , which normally brings us here , was cancelled , with no explanation from the airline , and we therefore arrived very late .
If Air France insi@@ sts on boy@@ cot@@ ting the European Parliament , we should take measures to prevent this occurring again .
Thank you , Mr Medina Ort@@ ega .
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation .
Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government ?
This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly .
Madam President , I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ort@@ ega yesterday .
I feel that the French authorities - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capit@@ als of the Union .
Absol@@ utely , Mr Na@@ polit@@ ano . Thank you .
Madam President , off the subject of aer@@ op@@ lan@@ e delays , I wish to ap@@ olog@@ ise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , Carol@@ ine Lu@@ cas , who is a British Member .
She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-@@ nuclear demonstration in Glas@@ go@@ w .
Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent , she was still held in cust@@ ody all day .
I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lu@@ cas receives an ap@@ ology . I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague , Mrs Hau@@ tal@@ a .
Thank you , Mr Lan@@ no@@ ye .
I have received your letter and have already cont@@ acted the British Per@@ man@@ ent Representative .
Madam President , I should like to make a request in connection with today &apos; s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the E@@ QU@@ AL report .
I should like the vote on the Community E@@ QU@@ AL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point .
I am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote ; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on E@@ QU@@ AL .
We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning .
Madam President , to follow on from the point that Mr Lan@@ no@@ ye made : Mrs Lu@@ cas was arrested just outside Glas@@ go@@ w for prot@@ esting against the Tri@@ dent base at Fas@@ lan@@ e .
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest .
I have , however , no sympathy for Mrs Lu@@ cas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity .
I have also been arrested for prot@@ esting at Fas@@ lan@@ e .
I did not hide behind any immunity .
I took the punishment that came to me .
Mrs Lu@@ cas should do the same .
Madam President , I would like to comment on the request Mrs St@@ enz@@ el has made to postp@@ one the vote on the Community initiative E@@ QU@@ AL until tomorrow .
In fact , this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee , and , given that it is a major Commission proposal , which refers to the agreements we reached last year , I consider it ad@@ missible .
We agree with Mrs St@@ enz@@ el that the request to postp@@ one the vote is ad@@ missible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups , so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broad@@ est majority possible .
Does anyone want to speak against Mrs St@@ enz@@ el &apos; s request , as supported by Mrs G@@ hi@@ lar@@ dot@@ ti ?
If not , then we will proceed to the vote .
( Parliament approved the request )
Madam President , under Rule 29 ( 4 ) you should be kept informed by political groups of any Members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group .
Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People &apos;s Party or does the Austrian People &apos;s Party continue to sit in that political group ?
Mr Corbett , I have not received any notification .
Madam President , I am amaz@@ ed at Mr Corbett &apos; s reaction .
He should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here .
We are soli@@ dly with our Austrian friends who have proven to be good Europeans in the past .
They have our full support .
( Applause )
Agenda
With regard to the agenda for Thursday , following a request made yesterday in plenary , I propose extending the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance by half an hour to 6@@ .00 p.m. when the vote will take place .
( Parliament gave its ass@@ ent )
Commission &apos;s strategic objectives and legislative programme
The next item is the joint debate on the Commission statements on its strategic objectives for the coming five years and the annual legislative programme for 2000 .
I therefore immediately give the floor to the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , a five-@@ year programme is an extremely important undertaking , and this is why I preferred that you be given the un@@ abri@@ dged text of the speech , which is available in four languages .
To respect my speaking time , I will con@@ fine myself to referring only to the broad out@@ lines of my programme : a programme for the da@@ w@@ ning of a new legislat@@ ure and a new century , when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective , a Europe which is currently in a paradox@@ ical situation .
Let us remember that for half a century , Europe has provided us with peace , security and freedom and a united Europe has also contributed to giving us a period of unprecedented prosperity .
Nevertheless , despite these aspects , European citizens are disappointed and concerned : by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough ; by a Europe tra@@ iling behind in technology , and seem@@ ingly falling even further behind , and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too ; by the European institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times , starting with the Commission itself .
The crisis in the Commission was , in fact , a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and its citizens , and the low turn@@ out at the European elections was a worrying indication of this .
Even stronger still , however , is the sense of in@@ security , the feeling of being un@@ prepared in a new world that is moving for@@ wards , a world which is completely changing , where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference .
This is not the first time this has happened : Europe was once confronted with a similar transformation , an explosion of its markets , a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world .
I am referring to the six@@ teenth century when the discovery of America turned everything up@@ side down .
Some countries - such as France and Spain - managed to meet the challenge , giving rise to great nation States ; other countries - such as Italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the head@@ way that they had accum@@ ulated during the first part of that millenni@@ um : head@@ way in science , technology , economic progress , defence structures and military organisation , philosophy and literature .
Today , Europe is facing a similar challenge , and we know that , just as history has been unfor@@ giving in the past , it will not be for@@ giving in the present .
In this context of wholes@@ ale change , and in order to prevent our nation States van@@ ishing again , in the wake of globalisation which is creating hi@@ therto unprecedented sc@@ ales and challenges , Europe needs to be economically strong , because globalisation demands unity , because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at European level too .
But more vital still is a Europe that feels strong in the political arena .
In years past , the single market and the single currency have been the pi@@ vot@@ al point of our actions , the ma@@ inst@@ ay of European life .
Today , the new fron@@ tiers of European integration are political fron@@ tiers : common foreign and security policy , justice and internal security , and - to a less@@ er extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our co@@ existence is based .
The Commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000-@@ 2005 , a programme that was immediately sent to the European Parliament and with which you are already familiar , so I will not go into detail about it now .
Some of you may find it lacks detail , but no political structure sets out detailed five-@@ year programmes .
This is the European Union , not the Soviet Union .
Our programme highlights the major points of reference , the major areas for action : firstly , the development of new forms of governance for Europe ; secondly , extension and enlargement of the area of peace , freedom , and security ; thir@@ dly , the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy ; four@@ thly , safeguarding and improving quality of life .
These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years .
This is an effective , transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institutions and the citizens of Europe .
But it is not only enlargement that is ur@@ ging us towards this re@@ think : as I said a few moments ago , it is also economic and political globalisation itself .
We must go@@ vern Europe in such a way as to make us more efficient , to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved , starting with the important issue of the involvement of women .
One of the main differences in the comparison made recently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mobility or risk capital , as women &apos; s involvement in economic life , an issue that has much more promin@@ ence in the United States than in Europe .
This is a field where Europe has , nevertheless , always been in the van@@ guard . We therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind , and all the institutions - Commission , Parliament , Council - will have to consider their own roles and their own policies .
We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper , although in order to finish it , we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference , and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001 .
It will not be a philosophi@@ cal Paper , but a practical Paper , full of focused proposals .
We - the Commission - are the first to know that we must have a total re@@ think , and we shall therefore do two things : we are , and will continue to be , fully committed to internal reform , and we shall re@@ think our policies in detail .
I have asked all the Commissioners - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analy@@ tical way - to pin@@ point all the activities that we can for@@ go .
The Commission must define what its fundamental activities are , what it must concentrate on and shed its non-@@ essential activities , thereby fre@@ eing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co-@@ operative relationship with individual countries , regions and local communities .
So we shall be fre@@ eing up new resources , but - I fear , and I want to state this before Parliament - the time will come when these new resources that we are already fre@@ eing up will , in turn , be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks : I am thinking of enlargement , the new sector of justice and home affairs , health issues and environmental matters .
When that time comes , when we have used up all our resources , I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources , but what I am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources , we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be comm@@ ens@@ ur@@ ate with the new tasks that we will be taking on .
As for internal reform , you well know how committed my Commission has been to this since day one .
I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigor@@ ous and comprehensive internal reform , if it does not become more efficient , if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors , starting with the sector in which the worst back@@ logs have built up in the past - external aid .
Provi@@ ding aid rapidly , when it is needed , sav@@ es human lives ; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all .
When I speak about external aid , my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans . There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground , an extraordinary commitment given our organis@@ ational problems .
This is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans .
We must increase our efficiency in this area . We must re@@ open the Danube to boats .
It is contradic@@ tory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to har@@ ness their greatest resource .
We must de@@ contam@@ in@@ ate the river and , in view of this , over the next few days the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem .
We have done a lot in the Balkans : the new European Rec@@ on@@ struction Agency for Kosovo , the Balkans T@@ ask Force and new regulations to speed up procedures .
Nevertheless , we definitely have to do more .
If we do not do this , we shall have failed in our duty .
Remember that the Mar@@ shall Plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources : it was even more effective because it made us Europeans work together towards a new horiz@@ on ; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy .
This is what we need to do for the Balkans .
Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security , peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage .
We are clearly , once again , returning to enlargement , which must be put into practice in tan@@ dem with the extension of the area of security , peace and freedom .
We have made many promises in this regard , but I believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tre@@ ad .
Indeed , enlargement , which will be with us for our five years in office and beyond - I am referring to the aspirations of applicant countries - must hin@@ ge on concrete , objective criteria , and also on re@@ ass@@ uring public opinion in the countries involved and , to an even greater degree , public opinion in our own Member States .
There will be friendship , calm , openness but also a certain stric@@ tness in the enlargement process .
I repeat : we must re@@ assure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater re@@ assurance .
Our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement , or at the Balkans .
There are certain other key issues : relations with Ukraine , relations with Russia , relations with neighbouring countries and more importantly , the important question of relations with the southern Mediterranean which will be a crucial point for European history , and for security and peace in Europe for future generations .
In this regard , we have a responsibility towards the whole of Africa .
In recent times , Africa has raised hopes and has received offers of help , but nothing tangible has yet been achieved . In recent years in Africa , we have not seen a shift from totalit@@ arian regimes to democracy , but quite the contrary - a shift from democracy to totalit@@ arian regimes .
We need to provide alternative answers , otherwise epis@@ odes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to h@@ amp@@ er one of Europe &apos; s positive roles in history .
All over the world , Europe &apos; s actions must be guided by a deep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individuals and minorities .
We should remember that we , the European Union , are a union of minorities : we are all a minority within Europe .
There are concerns even within the Fif@@ teen , concerns which may even surface again in the next decade .
I am referring to the situation in Austria , where the Commission has remained true to its role , being dut@@ y-@@ bound to work towards the cohesion of the Union , but also the un@@ wa@@ ver@@ ing guar@@ dian of the Treaties , ready to pun@@ ish every minor breach of the principles of democracy , law and respect for minorities .
Some people have criticised me over the congrat@@ ul@@ atory message I sent to Chancellor Sch@@ üssel .
My message to you is : do not take the necessary and proper cour@@ tes@@ ies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content .
R@@ er@@ ead the letter : The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coinci@@ dence - from Article 6 of the Treaty , I repeat , Article 6 of the Treaty .
I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the Commission when they were elected .
This is what we wish to do : maintain our role as a supran@@ ational structure , maintain the role confer@@ red on us by the Treaties , but also be un@@ wa@@ ver@@ ing on principles and make jud@@ gements based on facts .
Last November , the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti-@@ racism directive .
I would ask the Council to adopt it swif@@ tly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion .
I will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme : the economy and quality of life .
I have already talked about the economy : we well know which basic ingredients will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs .
We must continue to keep inflation under control , proceed with liberalisation , ensure more competition , encourage the dis@@ sem@@ ination of information technology and all new technologies ; push forward with science , and push back scientific boundaries , and develop an ap@@ peti@@ te for being at the cutting edge of science .
The forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issues - dis@@ sem@@ ination of technology , employment - will be a decisive summit .
It has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind .
We are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity sli@@ p through our f@@ ing@@ ers .
Finally , our last commitment is to improve quality of life .
We have opened this chapter with the White Paper on Food Safety : we now need to make significant head@@ way in the environment sector .
The Erika oil s@@ lick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrates the pressing need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment .
The time has come to discuss , and then establish , a body for emergency civil protection in Europe .
All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred .
I think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen .
These are the challenges that we - the Commission but also all the other European institutions - are facing .
How will we judge , ladies and gentlemen , Madam President , the five years of our mandate ?
How are we going to assess the results of these five years ?
I do not know , but one bench@@ mark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together .
Let us take a very simple parameter : turn@@ out at the next European elections .
If it is higher than at the previous elections , it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we are faced with all these major political challenges , but precisely because of the recovery that is now under@@ way , we are also faced with major opportunities .
This , ladies and gentlemen , could be the decade of Europe .
Indeed , I would say that this must be the decade of Europe .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome the fact that the Commission submitted a document so that we could prepare for the debate .
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document .
And we welcome the broad out@@ lines of the speech which President Prodi has just given .
We read in the conclusions in the document that the five-@@ year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes .
Europe will press ahead with integration ; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will , in the end , re@@ unite our continent .
A demanding , ambitious , perhaps even proph@@ etic task and we wish you every success , Mr President of the Commission .
However , we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present .
I say that in all ear@@ nest@@ ness and I have chosen my words carefully .
I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union .
We in the European Union are one Community .
We belong together , even when there are problems .
Now is not the time to isol@@ ate but to unite and to complete together the task of uni@@ fying Europe .
Mr President of the Commission , you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks .
You have seen yourself as the guar@@ dian of the Treaties , and that is indeed your role .
For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned , we expressly respect , acknowledge and support you .
( Applause )
Mr President of the Commission , our objectives are one and the same : we want a strong Europe in the twenty-@@ first century , a democratic Europe which is able to act .
A Europe which def@@ ends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and , at the same time , looks after its global interests with dignity , pati@@ ence and convincing self-@@ confidence .
Europe &apos; s message , the European Union &apos; s message to the world should not be one of arro@@ gan@@ ce or even European nationalism , no ; it must be one of cooperation , partnership and peaceful development .
Globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world , which is becoming smaller and smaller , as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity .
Seen in this light , globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger , more of a coming together than a seg@@ reg@@ ation , more mutual enrich@@ ment than separation .
But we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans .
Globalisation is not only an economic process , it is also a cultural process , which is why we say : we want partnership in the world , we do not want the c@@ lash of civili@@ s@@ ations which many are predic@@ ting , we want partnership , a meeting , exchange and peace .
But we also say : we want to defend this European Community of tolerance , which is why a common foreign , security and defence policy is so important .
Neg@@ oti@@ ations with six central European countries are starting today , bringing the European family a step closer together .
We agree with what you said about the Barcelona process . All the countries in the Mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity , democracy and the rule of law .
For us , the Group of the European People &apos; s Party and the European Democrats , it is not only the reform of the institutions of the European Union which will be important in the next five years ; it is also important that we declare our faith in the single European currency and use the policy of stability as a basis for consoli@@ dating the European currency in coming years .
We therefore take the un@@ com@@ promising view that we must maintain a resol@@ ute and consistent stability pact .
We need structural reforms in the European economy .
Most importantly , we need to restore a European economy in which performance pays and people can work as entrepreneurs .
It would be Europe &apos; s und@@ o@@ ing if we were to end up with just a few multination@@ als and no future for small and medium-sized businesses in Europe .
( Applause ) The Commission has an important role to play here by getting a coordinated policy under way with the nation states to reduce taxes so that entrepreneur@@ ship pays .
We too want to help put Europe on its feet .
You spoke in your paper of decentr@@ alisation and subsidiarity .
We support that .
The nations , regions , towns and communities of Europe will be preserved .
However , there is a current trend - the &quot; fauna , flora , habit@@ at &quot; directive was quoted as an example - which , in my country at least , creates the impression that associations are b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ing national and regional institutions and submitting programmes to Brussels and that Brussels is then making decisions affecting the property of countless agricultural hol@@ dings in the countries of the European Union .
I merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future .
Mr President of the Commission , allow me to close with these words : as the Group of the European People &apos; s Party and the European Democrats , we have every interest in a strong Commission .
If you are persu@@ asi@@ ve in your actions , we all re@@ ap the benefits .
In this respect we wish you every success . However , we are also aware of our role as the Commission &apos; s wat@@ ch@@ dog .
If we have the mer@@ est sus@@ pic@@ ion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the European Union , and at present we have no cause for complaint - on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case - , but if European law is infr@@ ing@@ ed then we shall fight any such infringement un@@ com@@ promis@@ ingly , precisely because peace in the European Union is founded on this law .
We must preserve this law and peace in the European Union if we are to be able to go forth as peac@@ em@@ ak@@ ers in the world .
( Applause )
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to welcome the presentation of , and the first ever debate on , the Commission &apos; s programme for government - the word President Prodi is so f@@ ond of ; as I am -@@ for the whole legislat@@ ure .
Firstly , this is welcome because it explains , to our fellow citizens , what we are int@@ ending to do and what we are already doing . We must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future .
We have taken almost el@@ even months - President Prodi was nominated at the Berlin Summit in March last year - to establish a legislative programme . This is not entirely President Prodi &apos; s fault .
We are recover@@ ing from a crisis . However , I believe that , in the future , it would be appropriate for the investi@@ ture of the next Commission to coinci@@ de with the presentation of a legislative programme .
We are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances .
What we need here is good government , Madam President .
Since we are recover@@ ing from a very complex crisis , we must try to enhance our institutions and give them substance .
I would like to remind the House of something which we often forget , and that is that the investi@@ ture of the Prodi Commission , last September , received wide support . In our opinion , this demonstrates that the majority of us are in favour of progress and in favour of Europe .
I would like to point out that , within this broad consensus , there were some Gro@@ ups which said that the majority of Parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the Council .
It is precisely this which , in a sense , is hin@@ dering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme .
I am pointing this out because I believe that our support for the Commission also has to lead to continuity in the work carried out throughout the legislat@@ ure .
On the other hand , we are witn@@ essing the birth of a political Europe , which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon , and a European Union at the service of the citizens .
With regard to the events of recent days , I would like to say - and I am saying this on the day , and the week , that the Intergovernmental Conference is starting - we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental rights which , given what we have said about the Austrian crisis , I believe should be fully included in the Treaties .
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point .
In this regard , Madam President , I would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language .
Last week , the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition described the Austrian Parliament as a far@@ ce and a theatre .
Those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictator@@ ships with card@@ board governments .
There can be no democracy without a living parliament .
I believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now .
With regard to the four great priorities which President Prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us , I would say that we are very much in agreement .
Nevertheless , I would point out to the Commission that , as far as the Socialist Group is concerned , there has been a change of priorities .
When speaking of the commitment to full employment , we have to bear in mind that , these days , full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of Be@@ veri@@ dge at the end of the Second World War , that is to say , employment for the male head of the household .
We must argue for equality of the sex@@ es , the famous &apos; gender mainstre@@ aming &apos; , which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission &apos; s programme .
This means priori@@ ti@@ sing sex equality , the adaptation of the social model and , above all , an unequi@@ vocal fight against populi@@ sm whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat .
This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission .
It must be compl@@ emented with a forth@@ right fight against racism and intoler@@ ance so that we may come to recognise , in practice , the evolution of a Union which has become a magn@@ et for the rest of the world and an immigration zone , given its prosperity and seasonal demo@@ graphics .
I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue .
In this respect I would also add another element , which is economic government , given the single currency , and I believe this is in@@ es@@ capable .
This is another question on which the Commission must make progress .
With regard to the ambitious objectives and , above all , the Commission &apos; s important step of adopting this broad@@ ening of the process of negotiation and integration , I would like - and my Group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda 2000 .
Does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision ?
The issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential .
With regard to governance in general , I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms .
I would like to remind you of one thing : it is dangerous to re@@ think the entire governance of the European Union from here .
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity .
If we are capable of defining what our area of governance is , I think that would be very positive .
In all other areas , I believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion .
Not only should the Commission discuss this , but also our states , our parliaments and our civil society .
Madam President , I would like to refer briefly to the last objective , which seems to us to be absolutely fundamental : the stabili@@ sation of the continent and the strengthening of the Europe &apos; s role in the world .
It appears that there is agreement and support with regard to the priori@@ ti@@ sation of Sou@@ th-@@ East Europe , with regard to enlargement and - as I have said already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflicts , as well as an issue which we sel@@ dom talk about ; the Nor@@ th@@ -S@@ outh challenge .
We must not forget Africa , a continent which has been for@@ s@@ aken , not only by God , but also by Europe , nor our important contribution to co@@ operating with development .
Lastly , an issue for which we are increasingly responsible , as the world &apos; s foremost economic and commercial power , that is , Europe &apos; s voice in the world , which does not simply mean adopting an active approach to the Millennium Round .
It means the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institutions , for which Europe has an enormous responsibility .
This is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us . I hope this will be demonstrated when we hold the next European elections .
Mr President of the Commission , may I say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure , the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this House today : that is that the st@@ akes now are irre@@ fut@@ ably political .
They are political because we are moving on .
Even though we have not yet finished construc@@ ting all the economic building blocks , we are moving on from that kind of func@@ tion@@ alist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective .
The challenge of enlargement is political .
The challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs , of dealing with asylum and immigration and crime , is very political .
The challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political .
Because it is political it is more complex . Because it is political it is more sovereign@@ ty-@@ sensitive .
Because it is more sovereign@@ ty-@@ sensitive it is more vo@@ ter-@@ and citiz@@ en-@@ sensitive .
We need , therefore , to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives , to address , not merely the scep@@ ticism but the greatest enemy , the ap@@ ath@@ y which you identify .
The means of achieving this are difficult but they are real .
I appl@@ aud your view that we need more syn@@ ergy between our institutions , not just between Commission and Parliament , but also between these and the Council to under@@ score the extent of the political challenge .
We need more dialogue , not just with each other but also with civil society .
We need more explanation of what Europe is about .
We need to be able to confront fears and anx@@ ie@@ ties , because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself .
Perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that .
My group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a White Paper next spring addressing the issue of governance .
As we look at the Europe of networking which you describe , it is very important that Europe concentr@@ ates on its core business , that we have the courage to suggest areas where Europe may perhaps stand back .
That could convince people that Europe , in its governance , is not something run exclusively from Brussels , which concentr@@ ates and so@@ aks up more powers , more decisions , more authority .
That is the political core of the challenge and I think you have identified it well before this House today .
For my group , enlargement is the first priority against which all the other possibilities for reform must be measured , be they governance , be they the intergovernmental conference , be they reform of the institutions .
We see enlargement as a process of partnership , not a process of &quot; them and us &quot; .
We see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states .
We need to be able to prepare that ground carefully .
On south-@@ eastern Europe , I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements .
In the lifetime of this Commission and this Parliament we must succeed in the task of winning the difficult and un@@ easy peace in south-@@ eastern Europe .
We appl@@ aud the stabili@@ sation and association agreements , but we would like to see more .
We will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week .
The strategic paper emphasises the global role of the European Union .
Our central aim must be to give the Union a weight in global affairs comm@@ ens@@ ur@@ ate with its weight in terms of aid , trade and finance .
At the beginning of this decade we must fores@@ ee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end , and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies , where we fit into UN agencies and so on .
We need to open that debate .
In conclusion , this morning , the day after St Val@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s Day , the newspapers are saying that your hon@@ ey@@ moon period is over .
I do not know whether you are a romantic or not , Mr Prodi .
Perhaps this is a very un@@ romantic thing to say on such a morning .
However , we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it means we are now sett@@ ling down to business .
That is the way it should be .
Regarding the many ad@@ j@@ ectiv@@ al descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech - an energe@@ tic Europe , an enter@@ pris@@ ing Europe , a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me , in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues , give in one ad@@ j@@ ective , one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance : an enabling Europe .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally .
You gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme .
I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day-to-@@ day ones .
At the same time , however , it has to be said that , unfortunately , your programme remin@@ ds me in many ways of a party mani@@ fes@@ to .
There are a lot of good intentions in it , but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved .
As in any other party mani@@ fes@@ to , it is full of contradic@@ tions .
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them .
First let me speak about the economy and social development .
We have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment ; that is what was mentioned in your programme .
Should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria , in which - as you in fact hin@@ t at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be higher than , say , the three most successful countries in this matter ?
Ec@@ ological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of , because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure . But , unfortunately , as we all know , this is an area where the European Union is totally unable to act .
Do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference .
The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone .
In this respect , Parliament will definitely defend , along with y@@ ourselves , the importance of supran@@ ational decision-making .
One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation .
I think it is very credi@@ table that you should mention the concept of &apos; global administration &apos; , as others too have said here .
However , please learn from the events of Seattle : we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade , on the one hand , with all those values of human importance that we wish to defend , on the other .
You must embar@@ k on a dialogue with the international community .
Do please try to make the international organisations democratic .
The European Union could be cri@@ tically important in a process in which the United Nations and the WTO really do become subject to democratic monitoring .
We can submit motions for this together with you .
Finally , I consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society , although , unfortunately , this is another contradiction .
You ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the IGC .
We have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision-making .
What you just said is absolutely true : people want more engaged democracy .
In my opinion , this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to Europe and their interest in Europe too .
Madam President , my group was one of those which wanted to have a document allowing an exchange of views on the Commission &apos; s strategic objectives within the group before this debate , instead of being reduced to an on-@@ the-@@ spot reaction in plenary .
The main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists .
We are also pleased to see certain statements and intentions which it contains and which Mr Prodi has just under@@ lined and , in some cases , us@@ efully clarified .
The current globalisation process is - and I quote - &apos; exclusive rather than inclusive and has wi@@ dened the inequalities &apos; . The European Union &apos; s objective must therefore be to help define new ground rules within the Union and in international relations .
Clearly , many citizens are &apos; dis@@ en@@ chan@@ ted and anx@@ ious &apos; about the lack of real and lasting solutions to basic problems , such as unemployment and social exclusion , which affect our very existence . This must be one of our absolute priorities .
We do need to re@@ think many aspects of current Community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement is to be a success . We also need &apos; distinctive strategic partnerships &apos; with our neighbours to the south and east in order to achieve stability and peace .
There are plenty of areas for serious discussion .
We will carefully study the planned White Pap@@ ers and will participate construc@@ tively in the work begun or promised .
It is in this spirit that I have three criticisms to make . These must be taken into account if we are truly to shape the new Europe , as proc@@ laimed ambi@@ ti@@ ously by the title of the Commission document and Mr Prodi &apos; s speech and do so in reality not rhetoric .
The first and most serious criticism concerns the Commission &apos; s pro@@ pen@@ sity for rather gr@@ andi@@ lo@@ qu@@ ent self-@@ satisfaction with regard to the European Union and for a cur@@ s@@ ory and even con@@ desc@@ ending view of our partners . The perfect illu@@ stration of this cri@@ p@@ pling f@@ law lies in the opening sentence of the Commission communication .
A more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view .
Similarly , the idea that the euro has fo@@ stered a consensus on wage moder@@ ation is not really borne out by the repeated ner@@ vous orders issued by the European Central Bank to the trade unions which are deemed to be too demanding .
My second criticism follows on from the first .
This extreme difficulty in seeing the contradic@@ tions of the current situation and , where necessary , confron@@ ting these is seriously limiting the will , duly confirmed by Mr Prodi , to grant public demands .
For example , at least in the countries which I know well , I doubt that the intention , repeated three or four times in the Commission document , to reform &apos; Europe &apos; s social protection , health care and pension systems ... in a climate of more cau@@ tious public spending &apos; will meet the needs of those whose confidence we apparently want to win back .
My third criticism st@@ ems from the first two . The weakness of the analysis and the obstacles to the necessary changes have resulted in a project whose scope is severely limited by an over@@ abund@@ ance of gener@@ alis@@ ations , a rather in@@ decisive approach and therefore a lack of impetus .
But all is not lost .
This is a starting point and we have five years to succeed , provided that the political will exists and is expressed with sufficient force and clarity .
My group is fully intent on helping with this work .
Madam President , reform@@ ing and democrati@@ sing the institutions of the European Union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process .
This was the opening statement of Commission President , Prodi , when he presented the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years .
We await the White Paper on the governance of the European Union dealing with the issue of balance between Member States &apos; governments and the European Union institutions which is to be published this summer .
On this specific point I think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedures of the Commission .
The Commission , in its proposals to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference , has indicated that its preference lies in seeing smaller Member States lose their automatic right to nomin@@ ate a member of the European Commission .
This is a scenario whereby the European Union has a membership of over 25 Member States .
I do not want to see a two-@@ tier European Union built .
I believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the Treaty of Rome and all subsequent treaties .
There must be equality in terms of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions .
I would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small Member States to nomin@@ ate a European Commissioner that the United States of America gives smaller states the same recognition as larger states in the United States Sen@@ ate .
More or less each of the 50 states in the US has two elected positions in the United States Sen@@ ate , regardless of its population .
Any future reforms of the European Union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country .
It would be very difficult for those who propose a &apos; yes &apos; vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to have our nomin@@ ee to the European Commission .
Un@@ doub@@ tedly , reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer .
Once again there are special areas of polic@@ y-@@ making which should be left to the domain of the national Member States .
I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation , justice and home affairs , and foreign affairs at European Union level .
At present , under Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome , decisions taken at EU level concerning tax changes must be by unanimity .
I believe that this proposal should remain , as a common European taxation code would dimin@@ ish rather than enhance the work@@ ings of the European Union .
I support the enlargement of the European Union .
I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a stream@@ lined and structured manner .
However , we must remember that the public opinion of 3@@ 70 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties .
Chan@@ ges should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too swe@@ eping , otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed .
Madam President , I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radi@@ cal Members .
President of the Commission , a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out five-@@ year plans .
This is true , if we think of Russia &apos; s plans in the thir@@ ties , but at the start of your mandate , a few months ago , you yourself announced at the Conference of Presidents that you would , however , be presenting a legislative programme , or rather , the major policy lines of the European government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today .
In this House , in the past , large-scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the Commission , under its power of initiative , launched , not as experiments , but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress , but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the European Union .
In this case , Mr Prodi , we certainly have a kind of &quot; Ten Comm@@ and@@ ments &quot; : a whole raft of issues are listed , but if I may say so , we are left with the impression that the Commission is afraid to make any decision regarding what needs to be done about any of these points .
There was only one point that you really stressed - too much in my opinion - and that was that it looks almost as if the highest priority task that you are setting yourself is to cease &quot; unnecessary &quot; activities .
We should be careful , though , Mr Prodi , because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous Commission and backed this Commission - at least a parliamentary majority backed this Commission - precisely because , first and foremost , the reform of the Commission would bring consolidation , a new identity and a new awareness of being guided by a firm hand .
Let us consider the scenario whereby the Commission , not believ@@ ing itself to be equal to the task , wishes , or proposes to shed , for example , its powers to implement common policies , which it is nevertheless accord@@ ed by the Treaty .
What do we expect from a government in any case ?
What do we ask of this structure - the European Community - which is , so to speak , ambiguous and unique ?
It is right for joint resources to be controlled supran@@ ation@@ ally and not to be deleg@@ ated to the Member States or the TA@@ Os , as has been the case in the past .
It seems that you are proposing the same old menu , but with more uns@@ atis@@ factory implications , restric@@ ting the Commission , so you say , to the task of drawing up a few White Pap@@ ers , as you proposed .
My fear - even if you sha@@ ke your head , Mr Prodi - is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years , that the Commission should be a simple secret@@ ariat for the Council of Ministers .
If this is the role that the Commission intends to play over the next five years , we feder@@ alists are convinced , we are certain that this is not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the Commission intends to do in this regard .
The reform is important but , if it ag@@ grav@@ ates the situation , reduces or weak@@ ens the supran@@ ational powers of the Commission , then the structure of European integration , as planned by the founding fa@@ thers for the European Commission , will be at risk .
If we continue to get bo@@ g@@ ged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far , I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do .
The same goes for enlargement as an end in itself , without it being linked to a reform to make the European Union and its structures much more efficient , and to proposals that the Commission could have made at the IGC .
Mr Prodi , there is one positive thing that I would like to say to you , perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members , regarding the tel@@ eg@@ ram that you sent to the Austrian Government .
We approve of your position on this : you did well not to isol@@ ate that country any further .
In any case , we shall see what specific steps transp@@ ire when the time comes for practical action .
Mr Prodi , I repeat that this is , in our opinion , a slightly short-@@ si@@ ghted view .
Above all , it lacks drive in the sectors I have mentioned , for example , as regards the Balkans .
Can we really continue to leave the Balkans out of the enlargement process , dis@@ regarding the fact that Croatia , Macedonia and other countries also have the right to a place in this House that is open to all ?
Madam President , Mr Prodi , I should like to appl@@ aud your proposal for a radical decentr@@ alisation of the Union &apos; s activities and ask why , then , you are proposing a legislative programme which would lead to centr@@ alisation .
I remember your predecessor &apos; s speech five years ago .
Like yourself , he promised &quot; less and better &quot; , but Mr Santer finished up by having delivered &quot; much more and much worse &quot; , and I do not believe that you , either , can deliver the goods you promise .
You talk about decentr@@ alisation but prac@@ tise centr@@ alisation .
The legislative programme is , in fact , a lit@@ any of subjects over which the people are to be deprived of influence and in connection with which , Mr Prodi , you are to take influence away from the people , even on social questions .
You talk about greater transparency , but produce proposals which would lead to documents which , at present , are available for public inspection being locked away .
Your Commission consists of the only 20 people in the EU who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced .
Local politicians cannot do that , once legislation has been passed in Brussels .
The legislative programme from the Commission ought at least , therefore , to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the Member States and to the processes of popular democracy .
Otherwise , the number of laws produced in Brussels will just keep on growing .
We have passed 10 000 laws and as many amendments , and the applicant States have had 26 000 documents sent to them which , as debated by the Polish parliament , fill 140 000 sides of paper .
Even by this stage , that is already too many by far .
Brussels should make decisions on fewer matters and hand over more decisions to the people , the regions and the Member States . The only decisions which should remain with Brussels are those concerning cross-border issues which the national parliaments can no longer legisl@@ ate on effectively .
What is more , the work carried out in Brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent , so that people might at least have some small sense of own@@ ing the process , now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them .
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell &apos; Alba &apos; s attention to what the founding fa@@ thers of the European Union dre@@ amed of .
Take a look at Jean Mon@@ et &apos; s mem@@ o@@ irs .
What he envisaged was what he called a small , practical secret@@ ariat .
That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today .
Madam President , this morning the Commission President , Mr Prodi , has set out ambitious goals for the European Union for the next five years , lau@@ dable aims indeed , to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world : succ@@ eed@@ ing with enlargement , meeting the challenge of selling e-@@ Europe , introducing better principles of governance .
We accept that Europeans , particularly the younger generation , need to be given a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the years ahead .
But how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high ?
We need to match this vision with reality .
Here there are three elements I would like to contribute .
Firstly , we need a successful European economy .
We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across Europe , confirm the trend in privatis@@ ation and dereg@@ ulation , encourage the inser@@ tion of information technology and knowledge of the Internet , show that e-@@ Europe is a good initiative .
But we must avoid l@@ ur@@ ching back into the ol@@ d-@@ style regulation , sti@@ fl@@ ing individual initiative and enterprise .
We must not fear globalisation , but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society .
Without a successful European economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead , particularly of enlargement .
Secondly , we need to ensure that we legisl@@ ate only when necessary - subsidiarity .
Do@@ ing less but better - a central pl@@ ank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too .
We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation .
Mr Bon@@ de was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations , which seems to go in a different direction .
We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes .
Lastly , we need to ensure that there is proper , genuine reform of the European Commission .
Yes , the Commission - guar@@ dian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body , but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament .
The information problem , which Mr Bon@@ de just referred to , is treated like a stra@@ w in the wind , with the Commission seem@@ ing to restrict information to us , as citizens and as parliament@@ arians , although we have the right to it under the Treaties .
The Commission is not in fact today a European government .
The Commission does not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament .
We in Parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in Europe .
This governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the European Union , has its relevant role to play .
Therefore we need to have credibility , coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the European Union to our citizens .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the European Union , from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy ; even to the response by the 14 , the Commission and Parliament to the new coalition in Austria .
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions .
That does not apply to Austria alone .
The Union prof@@ esses its faith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in Austria .
However , the full potential of these values will only be realised if they are set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the Treaty and , in the final analysis , represent legal claims on the part of individual citizens .
When it comes down to it , Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough .
In this sense , the Commission must insist , and I should like to endorse and confirm this here , that the new Charter of Fundamental Rights become part of the Treaty and create binding , enfor@@ ce@@ able rights .
In this sense , the Commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom , security and justice and in this sense I disagree with the last two speakers .
Only reasonable , feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law can counter the ir@@ rational , misleading and de@@ mag@@ og@@ ic alleg@@ ations of the extreme right .
But , and I would like to stress this , this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment , margin@@ alisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti-@@ European , nation@@ alistic actions and reactions .
In this respect , Mr President of the Commission , I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you spec@@ ulated on and how it is perceived by large segments of the population .
The feeling of being at the mer@@ cy of others , of lacking in influence and of having no protection from the state leads in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote , as in the European elections and , in the worst case scenario , to extrem@@ ist voting patterns .
The Union , like everyone else , has not yet understood how to present the EU to the citizens of the EU as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation .
We are in the process of building a house but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our house .
What we need are not just reforms of the World Trade Organisation and the economic architecture - and , significantly , the President of the Commission for@@ got to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial architecture ; we also need confi@@ den@@ ce-@@ building measures for our citizens , who rightly expect help and support from and in the EU with the inevitable and painful process of adapting to new global circumstances .
In this respect , what the Commission says about boo@@ sting Europe &apos; s voice is important .
You yourself , Mr President , spoke of a model of which , unfortunately , there is little mention in the document . You said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic , social , cultural and ecological development , both internally and towards the outside world , which diff@@ ers from other models , including the US model .
In this sense , the USA is not only our partner ; it is also our competi@@ tor ; not our oppon@@ ent , our competi@@ tor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model .
I hope that what we have said so clearly and veh@@ em@@ ently here today will also be reinforced in the Commission documents .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , the greatest legacy which your Commission could pass on to the European Union would be to help res@@ ett@@ le and re@@ distribute the increasingly j@@ umb@@ led and confused powers and competences of the Commission , and perhaps of the Union itself .
You have made a bold start by rightly emphas@@ ising the need to focus on so-called &quot; core tasks &quot; .
That , as you have said yourself today , means that you must also identify tasks , policies and programmes which are peripheral or ir@@ relevant to the Commission &apos;s main vocation .
Many existing European Union policies and programmes may simply have passed their s@@ ell@@ -@@ by date , or have been proved un@@ wi@@ el@@ dy or ineffective when administ@@ ered at European level .
The challenge now is to have the courage to de@@ vol@@ ve as many non-@@ core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national , regional and local government .
If we are to succeed in persu@@ ading a scep@@ tical European public of the merits of further European integration , we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the de@@ vol@@ ution of un@@ warran@@ ted EU powers as we are in the evolution of new EU powers .
We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim , as they pres@@ ently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bon@@ de , that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-@@ way street only .
It must be shown to be a two-@@ way process in which existing EU policies and programmes , which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and propor@@ tionality , are de@@ vol@@ ved and repe@@ aled .
If you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead , you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and , as we have heard today , you will enjoy widespread support in this European Parliament .
Madam President , Mr Prodi , I fully support the thinking of the proposals made by my colleague , Mrs Hau@@ tal@@ a , on the Commission &apos; s strategic objectives for the coming five years .
I myself want to refer to a subject which has not been mentioned but which is on the agenda , namely the Commission &apos; s work programme for 2000 .
I am aware of the limitations of the exercise given that we have to work within the current Treaty and are therefore restricted by its operational rules . I am thinking in this respect of the important issue of taxation which I am not , however , going to talk about .
Rather , I want to start by welcoming certain proposals which you have made in this programme for 2000 .
These include all the proposals on food safety which are ambitious and important and those on maritime safety which are particularly important given the two oil sli@@ cks which have affected the coast of Britt@@ any and Turkey .
The Commission should react quickly in this respect .
However , on other issues the proposals could be more ambitious and faster acting .
I have some positive suggestions to make , particularly on the social area , the environment and the follow-up to Seattle .
Firstly , you have said that the citizens of Europe must be re@@ conc@@ iled with the institutions .
This is self-@@ evident and it is therefore essential to find out their main concerns .
For example , in the social area , it is not enough to announce a communication on a programme of social action .
We must move faster .
You must submit a new social action programme to us by the end of the year .
The issue of company clos@@ ures and mass redund@@ ancies is one which has been and still is very firmly in the news .
We are working on the basis of a directive whose limitations have been clearly demonstrated . I therefore propose that this should be reviewed in order to produce a directive which is more effective in protecting employment and also in imposing penalties on those who do not comply .
On the environment , you have announced a proposal for a decision on a sixth action programme on the environment .
This is all very well but it seems that the text to be proposed will not contain any specific objectives or a timetable for implementation . Perhaps you can correct me on this .
I personally feel that it is essential to have precise objectives and a proper timetable for implementation .
In terms of civil liability for the environment , it is right that we finally have a White Paper .
However , Parliament did ask for a legislative initiative six years ago .
The White Paper clearly fores@@ ha@@ d@@ ows this legislation but for when ?
You must realise that this process needs to be acceler@@ ated .
Finally , after Kyoto , we should be able to rapidly produce precise proposals .
Finally , on the subject of the WTO , the idea of rel@@ a@@ un@@ ching a new global round is not necessarily bad .
However , in the first place , the Commission should make proposals on changing the operational rules of the WTO .
The Commission has a role both within the EU and throughout the world .
The European Union must therefore ins@@ tig@@ ate a re-@@ evaluation of the WTO &apos; s operation which must lead to precise proposals being made on its rules .
Madam President , you spoke about fundamental political values , and one of the fundamental political values , even more important than democracy , is respect for others .
We therefore feel that you acted correctly in sending a message and that perhaps those who prot@@ ested about it are still feeling the effects of Bol@@ sh@@ ev@@ ism or Naz@@ ism . Democracy means dialogue with others and making others realise when they are wrong , but also listening to their explanations .
En@@ lar@@ gement - and Al@@ le@@ anza Nazi@@ onale has been repe@@ ating this for ten years in this House - must not mean di@@ lu@@ tion , that is , it must not ent@@ ail more risks .
The applicant countries &apos; hopes are at least as important as the hopes of our current fellow citizens , who are beginning to feel bit@@ terly disappointed by the way Europe works , as it is not resolving the most serious problems .
We therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreements which - should it be necessary - need to be re@@ drafted with regard to certain fundamental issues such as the environmental disaster that has occurred in Romania , reaching as far as Bel@@ grade , but above all , the continuing spread of ap@@ ath@@ y as regards major security issues .
Even today , we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power stations in the eastern re@@ public@@ s .
We therefore need resources available to spend before proceed@@ ing to enlargement , so that we can at last establish a European monitoring body responsible for monitoring quality of life and living conditions , with the aim of creating a new world where such trage@@ dies will no longer occur .
I would also like to say a few words on Africa , Madam President .
The third and fourth worlds have been abandoned : just one dollar , one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children .
Europe , which is so democratic , so progressive , does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board , while half of Africa is dying of A@@ ids and other diseases .
One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation .
Globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification , just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean lev@@ elling of values or damp@@ ening of hopes and enthusiasm .
The peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oli@@ gar@@ chy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few .
As for the Internet , Europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules .
On a personal note , please allow me at this time to congratulate the pir@@ ates who , by acting the way they are , are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently un@@ regulated .
We live in a world of rules and regulations : let us regulate the Internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future .
Madam President , as a Pad@@ anian taxpay@@ er , I have already experienced the vic@@ e-@@ like gri@@ p of the tax@@ man and former Prime Minister of Italy , Mr Prodi , since Pad@@ ania is liable to Italy for its taxes as well .
List@@ ening to him just now , I was concerned when he mentioned new resources , something that readily transl@@ ates as additional taxation , in view , inter alia , of enlargement , that is the entry of new States into the Union .
But why do they not buy their own entrance ticket ?
My Pad@@ anian elec@@ torate who , thanks to Mr Prodi , have already paid what in Italy is known as the European tax - re@@ paid only in part - have absolutely no intention , thanks once again to Mr Prodi , of paying another tax for someone else .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Members of the Commission , five months after its coming into office , the Commission committed to paper the direction in which it aims to ste@@ er the European Union .
The en@@ su@@ ing document is both ambitious and bom@@ b@@ astic .
Is it not rather mel@@ o@@ dramatic to say that &quot; the world looks up to Europe &quot; ?
Moreover , Europe as a continent is a great deal more than just the fifteen EU Member States .
It is not rather ambitious to ensure peace , democracy and human rights in the whole of Europe , no less ?
I am particularly in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by how the Commission considers bringing this about .
Does &quot; the European integration model as a rich source for global administration &quot; imp@@ ly the export of a large-scale perspective and concentration of power ?
According to the Commission , external policy can succeed , provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge !
So who is this then ?
The Commission as a whole , its President perhaps , the Council ?
You stated that the new European government requires strong institutions , while the Commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks .
We could not agree more with the latter .
It is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross-border issues and stopped deck@@ ing out the European car@@ t with powers which they are taking away from national authorities .
The document men@@ tions common values on different occasions .
Unfortunately , I find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking .
This raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on .
I am convinced that the Bi@@ ble , God &apos; s word , is the only pure source of proper standards and real values .
In the tradition of our continent , this realis@@ ation is an important one which merits recognition .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I am not sure which to go by : the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010 ?
Have you already included your second term of office ?
But seriously .
As it enlar@@ ges , the Union needs to be strengthened through stream@@ lining and dem@@ arc@@ ation .
First , stream@@ lining .
What you say in your programme about concentr@@ ating on the core functions of the Commission is only the beginning .
The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy .
In other words , a social , ec@@ olog@@ ic@@ ally-@@ orient@@ ated market , a secure currency , guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests extern@@ ally .
It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice ; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important .
Secondly , the new &quot; in &quot; word is flexibility .
However , increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into inter@@ govern@@ ment@@ alisation .
We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embra@@ ce the Member States .
That also applies to the inclusion of the civil society , which is a welcome step .
Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers .
( Applause )
Transpar@@ ency does not mean more access to more paper ; to our citizens , transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brussels and Strasbourg , when and with what right .
That is transparency .
Thirdly , the European Union cannot and should not en@@ large end@@ lessly .
Its borders are set not by how may countries want to join , but by how many countries it can accommodate .
( Applause )
If the price of enlargement is the water@@ ing-@@ down or even the break@@ -up of the present Union , then it must not be paid .
It is too high a price , not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union .
There is no future for a Union which is merely a ge@@ o-@@ strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone .
But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be acc@@ redi@@ ted by the people of Europe if it sees itself as a community of dest@@ ini@@ es .
That goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new , better quality of life .
Not only the Commission , not only the European Parliament but also the people and the states in our European Union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together .
In doing so , we need , no less , to re@@ inv@@ ent the European Union , but without destroying the present Union .
( Applause )
Madam President , in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democ@@ rat and Reform Party , the most important task of the Commission and the whole Union in the coming years is the successful realis@@ ation of enlargement .
The Commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the Union as soon as possible .
On the other hand , we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are water@@ ed down .
To avoid this the European Liberal Democrats have expressed the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider the various models of differenti@@ ated integration and create a conc@@ entri@@ c Union , in which there is a federal core and a less integrated outer ring .
It is clear that the subject of the internal differenti@@ ation of the Union will be raised at the IGC .
The subject needs to be discussed without prejudi@@ ce .
A technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough : we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the van@@ guard as proposed by Jacques Del@@ ors , for example .
In this way , a decision-making system can be created that is more effective , clearer , more open and more democratic .
I hope that the Commission will make its own proposal concerning how the expanding Union might implement its institutional and other differenti@@ ation .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , your inspir@@ ing speech , Mr Prodi , has quite won me over .
It raises expectations , but it can also lead to disappointment .
This is connected to what Mr Van Vel@@ zen was just saying , about the difference between words and de@@ eds .
The enlargement of the Union is inspired by our wish for peace , security and stability .
You are looking to re@@ assure the acc@@ eding countries , as well as European opinion .
But these days , we are witn@@ essing the exact reverse before our very eyes .
We have noted increasing levels of ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion and dis@@ quiet , even within regions where unemployment is quite low and prosperity very high .
We need to make our citizens feel at home , according to Mr Swoboda , and I agree .
This is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility .
This is probably linked to the standards mentioned by Mr Van D@@ am , namely subsidiarity .
It is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners , rather than competitors when it comes to policy .
It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens , where it can be exerc@@ ised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves .
That will require a new political culture , not only in words , but also in practice , which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and regions .
Regi@@ ons which , cultur@@ ally and economically , sometimes match the interest of some Member States .
The new Europe should not only expand horizont@@ ally , but also ver@@ tically , by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community .
This is what the Commission will be judged on .
Madam President , the Commission is today presenting its strategic objectives for 2000-@@ 2005 . These are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been g@@ los@@ sed over to prevent any conflict .
So , in the first part on the new forms of European governance , the words &apos; feder@@ alism &apos; and &apos; super@@ state &apos; are not mentioned at all .
Yet these are the main themes in any discussion of strong European institutions in which only day-to-@@ day tasks of execution are decentr@@ alised and a collective vision is promoted within an indi@@ st@@ inc@@ t whole . In this scenario the governments and national parliaments are mer@@ ged with the regional and even local authorities and with the civil society , all of which are described , with no form of hierarch@@ y , as &apos; integral elements of European governance &apos; .
These ambi@@ gui@@ ties mask many mis@@ understand@@ ings , primarily about our values .
It is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democ@@ rat .
It must clearly be accepted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best combines the objective conditions of an immediate , fair and transparent democratic debate , namely at national level in the main .
Yet the whole of the Commission communication is based on the opposite theory . In this theory , on the pretext of ensuring the best protection for peoples , their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limited by new regulations , new policies or new , restrictive legal structures such as the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights .
This Charter is really mis@@ named because it will actually reduce these rights .
In the Union for a Europe of Nations Group our principles are rather different .
Clearly we want to defend the countries of Europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations .
This is not impossible .
We must move away from the out@@ mo@@ ded feder@@ alist schemes promoted by those whose every idea on European matters comes from the M@@ emo@@ ires of Jean Mon@@ net .
Instead , we must open the European institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations .
This is the key@@ note idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication , Mr Prodi , but which is unfortunately not there .
Madam President , Mr Prodi , you claim to be shaping a new Europe yet you are lacking one basic element : confidence .
The confidence of millions of Europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this .
And how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resign@@ ation of the Santer Commission for corruption ?
You are responsible for millions of unemployed and for millions living in poverty , in@@ security and increasing mis@@ ery because of your ultra-@@ tra@@ de-@@ oriented and ultra-@@ liberal policies and because of the forced mar@@ ch towards the single currency .
You wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders . Consequently , you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and in@@ security and to a flood of un@@ controlled immigration .
You are now proposing to give all decision-making power to a hand@@ ful of officials . The Member States , local authorities and NGOs will simply become enfor@@ c@@ ers of decisions handed down from above , all on an equal footing in their submission to Brussels .
Not once does your t@@ wel@@ ve-@@ page document mention the national parliaments even though they comp@@ rise the elected representatives of the people .
Clearly , they have no role to play in your strategy .
You dare not even call a sp@@ ade a sp@@ ade , but instead hide behind p@@ seu@@ do-@@ trendy language by using the term &apos; governance &apos; for what is nothing more than federal , auto@@ c@@ ratic , centr@@ alised government .
Having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty , you are now reve@@ aling your ultimate goal . You intend to trade in all European sovereignty , whether national or collective , for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position .
Finally , you are dar@@ ing to condemn and pen@@ alise the free and democratic vote of millions of Austri@@ ans , or are allowing this to happen , just because the result does not suit you . Yet at the same time you are supporting Communist China and trading with countries which have openly violated human rights for decades .
Members of this House are today speaking out against a tel@@ eg@@ ram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Sch@@ üssel which , quite obviously , is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeu@@ vre .
Your sab@@ re-@@ r@@ att@@ ling fo@@ ols no one because , as you know perfectly well , whether you like it or not , you need Austria in order to reform the Treaties and harmonise savings tax .
You will cy@@ ni@@ cally and hypo@@ cri@@ tically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real powers in the construction of the European Union .
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this .
The governments which , through sp@@ in@@ eless@@ ness or ideology , support you are also responsible .
Brussels is not all of us , as you claim . It is all of you .
T@@ ell the truth for once . You could not care less what the people of Europe want .
They are free to choose only between your bra@@ ve new world and den@@ o@@ unc@@ ement .
It is over ten years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and yet your projects contain a strong hin@@ t of the gul@@ ags and mol@@ li@@ fying mor@@ alism .
We were among the small number who den@@ ounced the communist dictatorship .
We are and will remain among those fighting against Europe@@ an@@ ist dictatorship .
We call on all the people of Europe to resist your mon@@ stro@@ us projects .
The sal@@ vation of European democracies is with nation states . Europe &apos; s sal@@ vation lies in the cooperation of the nations of Europe .
( Limited appl@@ ause )
President Prodi , today you have presented the Commission &apos; s five-@@ year programme , and it has many objectives that we endorse . It is a programme based on real-@@ life situations and issues , and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues .
In my view , Mr Prodi , jud@@ ging from the text and the document that you had sent to us , one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance , and that is solidarity , not so much at international level as at internal level .
The Arch@@ bish@@ op of Milan , Mon@@ sign@@ or Carlo Maria Martini , is calling upon all politicians , in particular those like you and me , President Prodi , for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics is the principle of the active involvement of Catho@@ lic@@ s in politics , to re@@ consider a development process , which , in addition to economic profit , takes the margin@@ alised and those left behind by society very much into account .
It is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up , one which remin@@ ds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone .
It also remin@@ ds us of the need for a new growth model , one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the Catho@@ lic@@ s who are involved in social problems , who see , in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilit@@ ated among the public , the most natural instruments for building solidarity .
The fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom , which comes before economic gain - is thus enhanced .
This social freedom , which becomes mani@@ fest in initiatives favour@@ ing the poor , gives excellent results in terms of social justice and stability .
Mr President , public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion .
They must focus on service to people and commitment to achieving freedom for each individual , without for@@ getting , naturally , that all this cannot and must not conflict with the need to create business , to invest and risk , and in an ordered and focused system , entrepreneurs are able to make a substantial contribution to social growth solidarity .
In the age of globalisation , which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers , the European Commission cannot forget solidarity , and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man &apos; s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man .
Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart .
We hope that the White Paper and the actions of you and your Commission will put this into practice .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , &apos; Sha@@ ping the new Europe &apos; is an ambitious objective both for the Commission and for us all .
Our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries , but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union .
What sort of impression will an interested public , as well as the rest of the world , have of this five-@@ year programme ?
My reply would be : a new start , a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the Union in the 200@@ 0s will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be tru@@ sted and that we take seriously .
The Commission is correct in stating that the Union intends to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation . It fores@@ ees a just and more effective Europe that also recognises its responsibilities beyond its own borders out of solidarity and en@@ ligh@@ tened self-@@ interest .
Consequently , we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom .
I conc@@ ur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document . However , there are two om@@ is@@ sions which need to be addressed in our future work .
The first concerns women , gender and women &apos;s rights .
You talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth .
That is important , but equality is not only necessary for productivity , but also to make our societies more democratic .
It is therefore notic@@ eable that &apos; equality &apos; , &apos; gender &apos; and &apos; women &apos; are barely mentioned in &apos; Sha@@ ping the New Europe &apos; .
You mentioned &apos; women &apos; in your speech , but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals .
Is that because mainstre@@ aming is already so widespread in the Commission that there is no need to mention women ?
What other explanation could there be for om@@ itting women ?
The EU must not take on a mas@@ cul@@ ine person@@ a .
My other question concerns Africa , which is the only continent not mentioned in &apos; Sha@@ ping the New Europe &apos; .
Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world , the most overall poverty and a de@@ bili@@ t@@ ating AIDS epide@@ mic .
I know that Commissioner Niel@@ son and some of the other Commissioners are doing a fine job , but the rest of the Commission also needs to focus more clearly on that continent , partly by including it among its strategic goals .
Finally , I welcome the Commission &apos;s statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the EU is prepared unilater@@ ally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets .
I would merely ask when this is likely to take effect .
Madam President , President of the Commission , this is a vital document for the future and fate of Europe .
However , out of all the points , two specifically require our attention , and they are closely linked : peace and stability within Europe and outside Europe .
It is a question of objectives that must be pursued as a priority . For some time , we have all agreed on this notion , but we must also clearly affir@@ m that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement , even if this comes at a price .
Today , we have been called on to choose , for the forthcoming decades , between a Europe that might be less prosperous but a be@@ acon of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a Europe that might be more weal@@ thy , but where there is uncertainty over what the future might bring .
These goals will be more easily ob@@ tain@@ able only if the Intergovernmental Conference , which will draw to a close within the year , results in constitutional reform , providing the Commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement Council decisions or Parliament &apos; s co@@ decisions but will have to perform the role of a real European government .
The first suppor@@ ter of this reform should be Parliament itself , if it really wants to increase its role of interpre@@ ting the will of the Europeans and acquire the centr@@ ality which is part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrated Union .
Moreover , it will only be possible to give the Commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to the actual powers it will be accord@@ ed .
Without these prospects that we have outlined , Europe would , once again , have no future .
Madam President , Mr Prodi , we are pleased about the overall intention of the objectives announced which are in line with the challenges which Europe must overcome .
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century .
This event must under@@ pin enlargement .
Rather than using the word &apos; enlargement &apos; , I want to talk of re@@ unification which has much greater political significance .
Your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks . This is one of the goals of your reform .
In essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity .
Prec@@ ise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence .
However , saying is one thing and doing is another !
You must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers .
I will therefore judge you on your de@@ eds .
In the meantime , I approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication .
However , I must make two essential points . These concern the simplification and application of Community law .
In 1998 , 12@@ 3 refer@@ r@@ als were made to the Court of Justice for non-@@ application or non-@@ transposition and 25 % of environmental directives were not applied or trans@@ posed .
Rec@@ ent events have shown us that these regulations are essential .
Community law must not go un@@ applied because it is too complex or too ped@@ an@@ tic .
The Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this .
You are being realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate responses to the problems facing us , including unemployment .
Nevertheless , I regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed .
The emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any policy of hand@@ outs and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility .
You have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society , not only economically but also in terms of public health .
This is a silent revolution and in this respect I expected more from your communication .
Finally , you do highlight European research as being at the heart of our future .
Yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this .
Also , ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these .
If you want to better inform the people , you should start by strengthening li@@ aison with this House , as we are the representatives of the citizens .
Madam President , we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five-@@ year programme and of the programme for 2000 , set out with so much enthusiasm by President Prodi this morning .
To this end , I shall con@@ fine myself to stres@@ sing , out of all the choices available , the importance of three priority decisions which should , in the draw@@ ing-up of action programmes for the government of the Union , be the basis for both the Commission &apos; s agenda and the actions of the European Union in the coming months .
Firstly , the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors , with the backing of the European Investment Bank .
Secondly , the approval of investments - where the parameters are binding when drawing up action programmes on employment - to be made in individual countries via Community projects in the priority sectors of research , innovation and training .
I feel that these parameters - particularly those of a qualitative nature , resulting from investments in continuous training , refres@@ her courses , adap@@ tability and re@@ training of older workers - are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives , that are always debat@@ able , regarding new employment or employment cuts .
If , among other things , as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stresses as well , the Commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue , focusing on an agreed strategy of soci@@ alisation and diff@@ u@@ sion of knowledge , in other words , a strategy for employ@@ ability and the definition of its rules , this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and con@@ sen@@ su@@ al management of the restructuring and re@@ employment processes .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , you have come here today , Mr Prodi , in a very reform@@ ist and ambitious mood .
I welcome you and your ambition .
Am@@ bition will be needed , given the m@@ am@@ mo@@ th task which awaits us .
In order to make these reforms , however , and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme , we must be very sure , not only of the strengths of the re@@ former himself , but also of the opinions of others .
You say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission , but the Commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice .
We have 1.@@ 27 % of the Community &apos; s GDP .
Not a euro more or a euro less .
It will not be us who refuse these new resources . You should ask the Council .
These financial perspectives are adjusted to within a milli@@ met@@ re .
In order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans , we will have to negotiate a significant revision of C@@ ateg@@ ory 4 , and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in appro@@ ving the 2000 budget .
I would remind you that this Group , the PPE-DE , does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones .
The political priorities must be set by this House and the MEPs .
Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will dis@@ gu@@ ise the limitations of the Community financial system .
It is all very well for us , by mutual consensus , to make an effort in terms of budgetary ration@@ alisation , but you must be very aware that the lack of resources , the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget , continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved .
We therefore wonder whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them .
Madam President , the Commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever .
On one hand , there are the words and , on the other , their real political meaning .
We Socialists appl@@ aud the Commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty .
Yet how can the gul@@ f between political rhetoric and reality be filled ?
What is meant by the Commission &apos; s declared objective of &apos; economic reform &apos; in the labour market ?
Does this mean more flexibility , in@@ security and fix@@ ed-@@ term contracts ?
Everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth .
The Union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient .
We Socialists desper@@ ately want a European pact for growth and employment .
The ingredients of this policy are well known . They are the stim@@ ulation of public and private investment , increased investment in research , education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise .
In this respect , the e-@@ Europe initiative is to be welcomed .
In the world of new technologies , the main danger remains that access to information will be easier the ri@@ cher you are .
The gul@@ fs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era .
On one hand we have the ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ance of the financial markets and the explosion of wealth and , on the other , more widespread exclusion .
We are asking workers to be flexible , innovative and ever more productive , yet the fruits of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholders alone .
The European Central Bank is keeping very quiet about the stag@@ gering rates of return on financial assets , yet it never mis@@ ses an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity .
How do we explain to workers who fall victim to the ration@@ alis@@ ations of the worldwide Monop@@ oly game that they must be prepared to change career several times in their working lives when the cap@@ tains of industry , having lost the gam@@ ble of a tak@@ e-@@ over , leave with compensation of EUR 30 million ?
For years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liber@@ alised .
The sectors which have been liber@@ alised are experiencing an av@@ al@@ anche of mer@@ gers and acqu@@ isi@@ tions , leading inevitably to monopoly situations .
All these stock market batt@@ les are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15 % , 20 % or 25 % which are un@@ realistic in the long term .
The un@@ f@@ etter@@ ed rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase .
The main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but de@@ flation caused by the collapse of the spec@@ ulative bub@@ bles on the international financial markets .
To conclude , the next five years will be crucial .
We need new rules to regulate globalisation and we need investment in the real economy and in people .
We need the Member States and the Commission to ensure the social dimension of the market economy in a visible manner .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , in my view , this strategy paper has two clear weaknesses .
There is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one .
I am thinking of transport policy and regional policy .
You have excellent Commissioners for both issues in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier , yet still you attach too little importance to these areas .
And do you know why ?
Just look at transport policy ; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ec@@ ologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries .
I would be grateful if the President of the Commission would listen to what I have to say , although of course he has no obligation to do so .
Let me give you three examples .
First : we need reasonable dereg@@ ulation of the railway sector because we want to shift freight from the roads to the railways .
That makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view .
Without dereg@@ ulation we will not make any head@@ way with a reasonable transport policy .
The same applies to European air traffic control .
Our citizens cannot understand that we are dereg@@ ulating air traffic , but leaving 15 different sectors in the sk@@ ies which are under national control , which have an adverse economic impact on the airlines and which poll@@ ute the environment .
You still have not finished that agenda .
Commissioner , far too little is said in your paper about regional policy .
Economic and social cohesion in the EU is a fundamental task of this Community .
If we fail to complete it , citizens in less favoured regions will d@@ read enlargement .
We must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means .
Then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it .
Mr President of the Commission , if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor regions , then this Union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , the fact that we are form@@ ulating new programmes does not mean that we should negl@@ ect those older programmes which are at implementation stage .
From that stand@@ point , it is useful that the Commission &apos; s work programme comes back to the issues of Agenda 2000 , the common agricultural policy , which includes fishing , and secondly , the activities of the structural funds .
I hope this reference means that the re@@ organisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000 .
The Agenda 2000 issues are , of course , ones that relate to your third and fourth strategic objectives , the economic and social Agenda and a better quality of life .
What your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major , high-@@ minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the Commission intends to deplo@@ y .
I do not necessarily mean financial resources .
The implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money .
There must also be savings .
But what we need is the analy@@ tical resources : these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital .
This is because it is essential to achieve two things : the European model of multi@@ functionality in agriculture must be secured , and this must be done in a way which facilit@@ ates the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products , mainly to the benefit of developing countries .
It is not easy to combine those aims .
There is no obvious way .
There may well be contradic@@ tions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the Commission has pointed out those contradic@@ tions and how it proposes to deal with them .
As regards the other aspect of Agenda , the aspect of cohesion and regional development , there we do indeed have great achievements to point to , but there are still less developed regions , particularly island regions , to which more attention should be paid .
As for fishing , there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the pre@@ dat@@ ory exploitation of fishing grounds , which has gone as far as to wi@@ pe out entire species of fish , will certainly prove fruit@@ ful in the future .
Perhaps these issues should be appro@@ ached with greater attention and a greater es@@ pri@@ t de fin@@ esse .
Madam President , I want to start by rein@@ forcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five-@@ year plan .
In setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present .
That was a point made very for@@ ci@@ bly by the leader of my group , Mr Poettering , in his opening address .
The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful European economy being in place .
That foundation is clearly the single market .
How strongly is the single market established at the moment ?
I want to remind Mr Prodi , and his colleagues who are still here , of the findings of the Commission &apos; s own survey among 3000 European businesses .
N@@ early 40 % of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications .
This is the Commission &apos; s own survey .
These are the classic symptoms of continued ob@@ struction by national governments - bureaucratic re@@ d-@@ tape blocking market entry .
The Commission &apos; s programme shows a distur@@ bing compl@@ ac@@ ency about the completion of the internal market .
We have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers , intensi@@ fying pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and , of course , extending into crucial new areas like financial services .
Only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved .
An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union .
The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a col@@ o@@ ss@@ al achievement .
I conclude by saying , on behalf of all my Conserv@@ ative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this Parliament - that we ple@@ dge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieving this historic task .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , I should like to start with a quote : &quot; The Commission will continue to work towards establishing a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme .
The Commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine European policy on asylum and immigration . It wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime &quot; .
That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security , freedom , citizens &apos; rights and judicial cooperation .
A paper this short is a far@@ ce .
A far@@ ce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a b@@ lat@@ ant contradiction to how things actually stand .
A paper such as this is no basis for a sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard .
It has been ext@@ oll@@ ed and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it ; we need a basis for a sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard .
We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme .
What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly , and those who are not fle@@ eing know where they stand .
We want instruments to prevent abuse .
We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States &apos; capacity to absor@@ b immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EURO@@ PO@@ L , for example , so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime .
We debate these issues intensi@@ vely and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission , even where it is merely submitting a paper .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation , on which there is a broad convergence of views between the Commission documents and the positions of the Socialist Group .
This is not the case in other areas , as has already been pointed out .
We share these views because we are in favour of world trade , but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards , common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind . This aim is that trade should benefit development , and particularly harmon@@ ious development in which the values of citizenship do not only apply to the world &apos; s most dynamic and competitive regions .
On the other hand , what does this statement tell us about principles ?
This regulation and these standards have brought an increased volume of trade for the World Trade Organisation , in other words , increased wealth , but when we look at how this wealth is distributed , we see , unfortunately , that the gul@@ f between the world &apos; s rich@@ est countries and blocks and the poorest and least developed countries continues to increase .
It is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves , what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve ?
What good are the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the World Trade Organisation works , if they cause trade to increase on the one hand , but on the other , they create problems and above all cause this gul@@ f between rich and poor countries to grow ?
That is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the Commission outlined here for the Seattle negotiations and for later ones .
We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be bra@@ ve and ambitious .
We need to be demanding and ensure that social rights , environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations .
Most importantly though , we must have a bra@@ ve and ambitious long-term vision for reform , not just of the WTO but also of the ILO , the United Nations and above all , of the financial institutions , specifically the IMF and the World Bank .
We must be bra@@ ve and not only see some aspects of globalisation . We must be bra@@ ve enough to have more of an overview of this process , so that wealth does not only benefit the most high@@ ly-@@ developed blocks and countries , but that there is also harmon@@ ious change and development in every region in the world .
Madam President , I would also like to welcome the Commission &apos; s initiative of presenting us with a report on its strategic objectives for the next five years , although I hope that it intends , in subsequent documents , to avoid the excess of gener@@ alis@@ ations and the v@@ agu@@ eness of the text which we are examining today .
Having said this , Madam President , I am prepared , once again , to be a voice cr@@ ying in the wil@@ der@@ ness as a result of the absence of a fishing policy .
It is really surprising that the Commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years , in view of the reform which must take place in 2002 .
There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years .
However , it seems that the Commission does not share this view , although it is the Commission which is obliged to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of 2001 , and it is on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification .
In fact , the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions , such as the European Parliament , which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and defic@@ ien@@ cies of the common fisheries policy .
We have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply .
L@@ ess than two years is not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy is an@@ om@@ al@@ ous with regard to the internal market regulations and that such an@@ om@@ ali@@ es should be resolved within the framework of this reform process .
Therefore , Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I would ask that this issue , which is of vital importance to a very significant industry within the European Union , be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years .
Madam President , I should like to add my congratulations to Commissioner Prodi &apos;s programme .
I particularly welcome his recognition of this virtu@@ ous circle of having sustained growth : the information society in an expanding European market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity , innovation enterprise , the entrepreneur@@ ial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra@@ -@@ high value sustainable jobs for our European citizens .
I have one observation , not a criticism , to make regarding Commissioner Prodi &apos;s statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy .
We must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the European economy restruc@@ tured .
After all , what is social justice if it is without full employment ?
Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens .
This is a key priority for us to focus on .
I should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the Commission which will help us : in particular Commissioner Liikanen &apos;s commitment to having an innovative knowled@@ ge-@@ driven economy .
Yes , e-@@ Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs .
I welcome the Commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprises and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro-@@ businesses .
That is important and something that can be developed through the Lisbon Summit .
I also welcome Commissioner Bus@@ qu@@ in &apos;s idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union .
Again , this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity .
You said in your summary , Commissioner Prodi , that liberalisation , competitiveness , keeping inflation low , innovation , science and technology are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs .
I very much agree with you on that , but we can take nothing for granted . There is still more we have to do , and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that .
So with those remarks I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme .
To me , this Commission strategy paper for the next five years reads like a scientific paper on the European Union or a declaration of principle .
Unfortunately , it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission .
As the spo@@ kes@@ person for cultural and training policy for my group , I would have expected more in the way of agenda from an Italian President of the Commission .
The Commission gives no soul to Europe .
Culture and training simply do not exist in this paper , despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe .
Just a few main points .
I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture ; they create jobs .
I am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstre@@ aming in all policy areas , about consoli@@ dating and improving the European dimension of training and education sy@@ ll@@ abuses and about networking training and education policies in Europe especially lifelong learning .
Mr President of the Commission , it is the new millenni@@ um and you made no mention whatsoever of the audi@@ o-@@ visual area of Europe .
Nor was any mention made of information policy and communications catering to the needs of our citizens .
It seems to me that something is missing from this programme .
Tru@@ ly European citizenship depends on our creating a real , visible area of training and culture .
Dec@@ lar@@ ations of principle are not enough .
We need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the Commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which I have just described .
Madam President , Mr Prodi , how would you take stock of your policy and work programme , what would your bench@@ mark be , if you had to make direct choices ?
You have the fine , charming idea that the outcome and the bench@@ mark for your policy and for your five-@@ year programme will be the result of the elections , or rather the turn@@ out at the next European elections .
When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in , week out to my constitu@@ ents , not in the r@@ are@@ fied atmosphere of this House , but on the street , then I ask myself , what can I say ?
Mr Prodi , what can I say ; what is there that is new ?
There is nothing new in your work programme .
You have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year &apos; s work programme .
Does that give me hope for the year 2000 ?
No , it does not !
In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite cle@@ ver .
You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas .
Have you done so , Mr Prodi ; have you even read your work programme for the year ?
No , you have not done so .
You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement , despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement .
Nor have you integrated it into economic policy , competition or the internal market .
You have not integrated it anywhere .
You have tack@@ ed a few components together but you have no overall structure .
You said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the Danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure ; no , Mr Prodi , we need , at long last , to start trans@@ posing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored .
You say in your five-@@ year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation .
Mr Prodi , you do not know what you are talking about .
The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world .
Where it falls short , what is missing , is transposition in the Member States and monitoring .
It is time you took your job seriously , it is time for you , as President of the Commission , to box the Member States on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties .
It is no good spending time on h@@ ob@@ bi@@ es when there is a day &apos; s work to be done .
That is what we expect of you in the next five years .
( ES ) Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , as chairman of this Parliament &apos; s Committee on Fisheries , Mr Prodi , you are not making things easy for me at all .
I feel duty bound to publicly den@@ ounce the fact that fishing is ab@@ sent from the programme which you have presented to us .
The next five years of the Prodi Commission - as you sol@@ em@@ n@@ ly announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change .
I hope that this change will not mean an even greater margin@@ alisation of fishing , since the silence of your programme , with regard to fishing , is de@@ af@@ ening .
Not a single line , nor a single word , refers to fishing or the CF@@ P .
I am not asking for details or specific points , but I believe that a mention was required .
How could you completely ignore a common - I repeat ; common - policy with such an economic , social and regional impact , and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of Europe ?
This is all the more serious , if that is possible - as others have said - bearing in mind that your Commission , Mr Prodi , has to carry out nothing less than a revision or reform of the current common fisheries policy , which you are legally required to do in 2002 .
Does the Commission intend to do nothing - at least it has announced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either ?
What message can we send to the fishermen of Europe , and their families , and the fishing industries , both the extrac@@ tive and processing and marketing industries , and the related and secondary industries which depend on fishing in so many European ports , in so many European regions , in most cases peripheral regions , who rightly demand that this problem be dealt with as a priority ?
You have made an explicit reference to the CAP for the coming years , but you have not done so for the CF@@ P , with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent exceptions - as has already been said - and in a global context , in the context of globalisation .
This House has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second .
I would therefore ask you , Mr Prodi , to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today .
Our parliamentary Group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you .
Mr President of the Commission , this is indeed an historic moment for Parliament , a five-@@ year programme following the crisis of the Commission .
On behalf of the Socialist Group , I would like to focus on the point of internal reform .
We wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consult@@ ative document and which is also included in the programme of Vice-President , Mr Kinnock , on behalf of the Commission .
We consider it to be of utmost importance that , in terms of financial control , personnel management and bureaucratic short-@@ cuts , we can expect swi@@ ft lines of policy and a more effective bureaucracy , for the benefit of the citizen .
At the same time , we are aware that this is a massive programme and that , during the over@@ hau@@ l in the next couple of years , it will be necessary to keep the actual results coming in , as before .
Much like in the Netherlands , where , at a given point , women wo@@ ke up to the fact that , by referring to European legislation , they could improve their status in terms of social security , this is now also the case for scores of other citizens .
They want to see results .
Democracy , transparency and clarity always lead to results , citizens value results and this is what the Commission is judged on .
This is exactly the point which Mr Swoboda and also other Members made : fear of modernisation , globalisation , and the individual losing his own sense of safety and security .
This can be prevented if a European social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas .
I would therefore strongly advocate internal reform which delivers fast and concrete results at a social level . This gives the citizen a sense of recognition , here in Europe and elsewhere .
Because this citizen - one in five globally - still has no access to el@@ ementary social provisions , such as education and health care .
These are really the people who deserve our solidarity .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I have read and re-@@ read the Commission &apos; s document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office .
I am delighted that it is being discussed in Parliament , but I also note the compromises and the om@@ is@@ sions in it .
The Commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion , to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union &apos; s regional policy .
And this is true even when it addresses the issue of enlargement .
Are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequ@@ ent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved ?
Certainly not !
At the same time , it was rightly pointed out that Europe must evaluate its role as a joint partner with developing countries , and strengthen its activities designed for fighting poverty .
This document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included .
I think the fact that the Commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious .
It plays down one of the Treaties &apos; principles - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all of the European institutions &apos; policies and measures . It seems to ignore the fact that various European regions are still considerably less advanced than others .
It also for@@ gets that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right . Unless we achieve real convergence , the cohesion of the European Union itself will be at risk .
We should take into consideration the sixth perio@@ dic report on the situation of the regions in the European Union , for which the Commission is responsible .
This report confirms that whereas an average level of development is given a rating of 100 , the ten so-called &quot; strongest &quot; regions reached an average of 15@@ 8 , and the ten so-called &quot; weak@@ est &quot; regions reached a figure of around 50 .
You may draw your own conclusions .
50 is exactly the level of development of my own region , the Az@@ ores , one of the regions defined in the Treaties as ultra-@@ peripheral .
I am waiting for the Commission &apos; s report on the ultra-@@ peripheral regions , which the Council decided should be drawn up by December 1999 .
I shall finish by rest@@ ating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion , there will be no cohesion at all , only dis@@ unity .
As intended by the Treaties and the will of the people , the Commission is the driving force of European construction which is like a rock of Sis@@ y@@ ph@@ us which we have to push back up to the summit again together after each round of enlargement . We therefore need a strong Commission but one which rel@@ ies on the support of a parliament .
This House is therefore your ally but not one which is too accommod@@ ating . You must therefore listen to our opinions , one or two of which I wish to express in my brief speech .
Firstly , Mr President , although your two predec@@ essors concentrated on developing an internal market and establishing the single currency , it has been left to you to develop this whole value of citizenship which is at the heart of European construction .
You must not allow yourself to be di@@ stra@@ c@@ ted by the sole issue of enlargement , however important this may be .
You must go further , towards re@@ conc@@ iling the people with Europe , in particular those people who are falling victim to economic , social and , probably , in the future , technological divisions .
The promotion of scientific development and new technologies and access for all to these technologies will not be provided by the market or competition . The latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community services of health , education , transport , communications , water and whatever else .
Your action programme and your objectives are reserved , even silent , specifically on the stim@@ ulation of public investment which is needed .
This is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services .
This is an absolute priority if you are to re@@ conci@@ le Europe with the people and ensure that the people choose Europe rather than J@@ ör@@ g Hai@@ der .
Madam President , the Commission was correct to make food safety one of its top priorities .
The recent diox@@ in sc@@ are in Belgium , prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain , and the continuing contro@@ vers@@ y over the safety of gene@@ tic@@ ally-@@ modified foods , have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat .
If the Commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the European Union institutions themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the rights of EU citizens .
I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety , public health and consumer confidence features promin@@ ently in the Commission &apos;s work programme for 2000 .
However , I was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper .
In its present form , what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decisi@@ on@@ - and law@@ -@@ making powers more similar to those of the US Food and Dru@@ g Administration , which has already established credibility in this particular field .
Furthermore , future legislation must address the modus oper@@ an@@ di of the relationship between the European food authority and the authorities of national Member States , for example the food safety authority in Ireland .
This body , for example , alongside the recently established cross-border body in Ireland for food safety , is already doing good work .
It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by defic@@ ien@@ cies in EU legislation .
My fear is that such defic@@ ien@@ cies in EU legislation could lead to tur@@ f wars between national and EU bodies , who should be working together rather than against one another .
That is something we must guard against .
Madam President , the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair .
We will be looking for the detail year by year , for example in the social action programme to be un@@ vei@@ led this year .
We will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy , and will be applying a number of tests .
We will be looking at the extent to which we can create an equ@@ ilater@@ al policy tri@@ angle combining economic policy , employment policy and social policy . At the moment , social policy is tra@@ iling well behind economic and employment policy .
Within the employment strategy we will look for a deep@@ ening and broad@@ ening of the strategy following the review under the Portuguese presidency and within the framework being proposed by the Portuguese Presidency .
Within the social dimension we will be looking for a deep@@ ening of the internal market with a social aspect .
The sp@@ ate of mer@@ gers , tak@@ e@@ over@@ s and transfers that we are experiencing with the deep@@ ening of the market means that we must act to update the mat@@ rix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past ; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive .
We also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change .
That is the successful way to manage change , and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place .
Finally , with the emergence , the res@@ ur@@ gence , of the xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic Right within the European Union I hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to give reality to Article 6 by using Article 13 to combat discrimination , and Article 137 to combat exclusion .
We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now .
The aspirations are fine , President Prodi , we want those aspirations to be matched by action .
Madam President , I hope that it is a good omen that there are still a few i &apos;s left for me to do@@ t .
Mr Prodi , you set great store in your reform efforts on introducing a forwar@@ d-@@ looking employment policy throughout Europe .
However , for the economic sector which I represent , i.e. fisheries , this means change .
We need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which fo@@ sters personal responsibility .
We must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utili@@ sation in undertakings in the processing industry .
What it comes down to is the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and off@@ shore fishing .
However , I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor , which affects not only Germany but all the coastal regions of Europe .
Plus , this branch of the economy is one of the few sectors in which Europe has fully integrated powers to decide and act , which is why we expect to be given a right of codecision here too .
This has since been unanimously approved .
The fisheries policy is due for review in a few months &apos; time , i.e. at the beginning of the year 2000 .
So it is somewhat up@@ setting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper .
I hope that this is a mis@@ understanding .
Please , Mr Prodi , stand by your word and implement your promises .
Madam President , many of the speakers from the Socialist Group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the Commission &apos; s statement .
However , we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission .
One area that I want to focus on , in addition to those already identified , is that of cultural diversity in Europe .
The introduction to this statement acknowled@@ ges under the quality of life section that it is important .
But there is nothing in the statement which indicates that the Commission intends to take any steps to deal with the issue of cultural diversity .
Unless we address these issues , unless we dismant@@ le these negative ster@@ e@@ otyp@@ es , unless we take what is best from our various cultures and languages and protect and expand it and ensure that we are serious about having a diverse Europe , we will fail .
Those who are currently coming to the fore in Europe based on fear will win the day .
I am seriously concerned that unless the Commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a cohes@@ ive Europe , we will make progress on the economic front , on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy , but our citizens will still remain fear@@ ful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand .
If we do not take steps to deal with that , we will fail ultimately .
Thank you , Mr De Ro@@ ssa .
Before giving the floor again to the President of the Commission , I must tell you that I have received , pursuant to Rule 37 , seven motions for resolutions to conclude the debate .
Welcome
I would like to inform you that there is a delegation from Ku@@ wait , led by His Excell@@ ency , S@@ heik@@ h Sal@@ em Al@@ -S@@ ab@@ ah , Vice-@@ Prime Minister and Defence Minister , here in the official gallery .
On behalf of the House , I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament .
Mr President , I should like to raise a point of order in relation to the activities organised today by the Association of Parliamentary Assist@@ ants in support of their call for a statute for assist@@ ants to be adopted as soon as possible .
I understand that on 26 January the association wrote to the College of Qu@@ a@@ est@@ ors requesting permission to set up a table outside the Hem@@ icy@@ cle today to public@@ ise their initiative .
On the same day , I understand , Mr Bal@@ fe gave permission for the assist@@ ants to go ahead .
The Parliament services asked to meet with the assist@@ ants yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangements .
However , the appointment was cancelled at the last minute .
Parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn .
Mrs Ban@@ otti apparently promised to write a letter expl@@ aining why permission was withdrawn but so far no letter has been received .
Can you explain why the approval given to the assist@@ ants was withdrawn at the last minute ?
Do you agree that the assist@@ ants have a legitimate case which must be heard ?
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that such la@@ st-@@ minute cancell@@ ations do not happen again ?
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assist@@ ants is adopted as soon as possible ?
Finally , will you make sure that in the meantime Parliament &apos;s rules are properly implemented and that assist@@ ants are paid , as they should be , on the basis of all the work they do for us ?
Without them we would not be able to function .
Mr President , I also rise on a point of order .
Are there any rules or regulations that go@@ vern demonstrations within the building of this Parliament , outside the doors of the Hem@@ icy@@ cle , to ensure that MEPs are free to come into this Hem@@ icy@@ cle to discharge their mandate ?
If there are such rules , who has the responsibility for enfor@@ cing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility ?
Mr President , I would like to take up the matter of the statute for assist@@ ants , which we have always considered to be a priority , and inform you that - as the Italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader , Mr Barón Crespo , we have forwar@@ ded the contracts that we drew up with the assist@@ ants to the Qu@@ a@@ est@@ ors .
I think that we need to make a tangible gest@@ ure in order to get a solution to this problem under@@ way . I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to invite the Members to do likewise .
Mr President , first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assist@@ ants .
Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assist@@ ants outside the doors of Parliament .
As all colleagues will know - and many of you have appro@@ ached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are fil@@ tered first of all through the Com@@ art committee of Parliament .
To give a non-@@ con@@ ten@@ tious example , no commercial exhibitions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reasons .
Following a letter I received yesterday , I immediately informed the assist@@ ants that we would propose that they be allowed to hold a meeting or demonstration , probably in the near future and possibly in the next month .
But all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the or@@ derly running of Parliament .
I signed a letter yesterday afternoon , in the meeting of the Bureau of Parliament , in which the assist@@ ants were informed of this .
But I am also told that they were informed verb@@ ally of this decision by the Committee of Chair@@ men of Gro@@ ups last Thursday , so they were fully aware of the decision .
There is no problem with them telling us the way they feel , there is no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament &apos;s next part-session .
But there was some mis@@ understanding , for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission .
But all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so-called Com@@ art committee .
As you can see we have many exhibitions around Parliament , whether they be about different countries or whatever .
This is not an attempt to either cens@@ or or go against the very real and justi@@ fiable principle that we should have a statute for assist@@ ants .
Thank you , Mrs Ban@@ otti .
I think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised .
Mr President , I wanted to point out an important matter of principle .
I personally believe that it is nothing short of sc@@ andal@@ ous that we hear Members of this Parliament att@@ acking the demonstration rather than looking at the solution to the problem , which is fair conditions , fair pay and fair hours .
We shall now proceed to the vot@@ e.@@ 1
V@@ OT@@ E
Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the European People &apos; s Party , the delegation of the Spanish People &apos; s Party , with regard to Mrs Terr@@ ón i C@@ us@@ í &apos; s resolution on the area of freedom , security and justice .
There have been some votes where we have not followed the guidelines of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party , and we have voted in favour of the Terr@@ ón i C@@ us@@ í resolution , which we consider on the whole to be excellent .
However , we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6 , because they seem to us to be legally incorrect .
On the other hand , we have voted in favour of Rec@@ ital J which , in fact , is in line with what I , as dra@@ ft@@ sper@@ son of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freed@@ oms , proposed to that Committee , with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference .
We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13 .
An appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for residents of non-@@ EU countries is something which the Spanish People &apos; s Party has been advoc@@ ating for some time .
For similar reasons , we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which , with the oral amendment , dealt with certain very justi@@ fiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity , since political rights , not just voting in local elections , but political rights in general terms , form part of the sovereignty of Member States .
Given the oral amendment , we felt we could vote in favour and that is what we have done .
.
( DA ) The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have chosen to vote in favour of the proposed resolution , but are at the same time aware of the fact that certain areas c@@ lash with the reservation Denmark has in the legal sphere - a reservation which the Danish delegation in the Group of the Party of European Socialists naturally wishes to respect .
This report which I voted against is less concerned with human rights than with &apos; comm@@ uni@@ ti@@ sation &apos; or the consolidation of Fort@@ ress Europe .
The supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the Dublin Conven@@ tions and Schengen Agre@@ ements and a further action plan from Tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants . In terms of human rights , this is a back@@ ward step .
Europe is continuing to exp@@ el nationals arriving from countries regarded as dangerous by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es . Yet some applicant countries in central and eastern Europe are taking in gyp@@ sy refugees exp@@ elled en m@@ asse from Belgium .
Kosovo Alb@@ ani@@ ans and Ser@@ b deser@@ ters are being refused refugee status , whereas Pin@@ och@@ et is cal@@ mly escap@@ ing prosec@@ ution .
The Europe of Schengen clearly finds it much easier to ho@@ und the persec@@ uted from the south than dict@@ ators , even though the UN estimates that we will need 15@@ 9 million immigrants to maintain a stable population between now and the year 20@@ 25 .
Europe should regul@@ arise the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections . Only then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice .
McCar@@ thy report ( A5-00@@ 26 / 2000 )
Mr President , I would firstly like to point out that I was Mayor of Bil@@ ba@@ o during the n@@ ine@@ ties , which gave me the opportunity to present one of the first urban pilot projects to be subsi@@ dis@@ ed by the Commission .
Secondly , when deciding which areas must be subsi@@ dis@@ ed , we must concentrate efforts on integrated projects .
Dis@@ par@@ ate actions are not effective .
We have to select locations by priori@@ ti@@ sing those which are most im@@ pover@@ ished and need@@ y , in accordance with the objectives set , that is to say , the social , economic , environmental and democratic management dimensions , as well as the relationship between them .
Thirdly , we have to bear in mind the syn@@ ergies generated by other Community programmes , as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question .
Finally , we have to put our trust in , and support , the institutions which are closest to the citizens , that is , the local coun@@ cils and bodies .
They have more first-@@ hand knowledge of social needs . They have more involvement in the problems and , furthermore , they know how to conc@@ eive projects and implement them effectively without weigh@@ ing them down with bureaucracy , and thereby achieve better results .
Lastly , in today &apos; s vote on our four amendments , two have been approved and the other two rejected .
This has obliged us to ab@@ stain from the final vote , because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when deciding which projects must be financed and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each Member State can dedic@@ ate , to UR@@ B@@ AN projects , that portion of the Structural Funds which it has not spent in accordance with Community programmes .
Mr President , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism had an in-depth discussion on the UR@@ B@@ AN initiative which produced many ideas .
As the smallest Community initiative in existence , we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected .
We regret this as there was actually money left over from the Structural Funds in some countries which could really have helped with pilot projects . We should remember that it is these UR@@ B@@ AN projects which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be established .
The Commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policies which are in place . It should make UR@@ B@@ AN projects coherent with future projects in budget lines entitled &apos; sustainable urban policy &apos; .
Finally , there is currently still no European urban policy within the European Union . Perhaps this point could be developed in the context of re@@ organisation and the Intergovernmental Conference so that the European Union finally has a true urban policy .
Mr President , I would like to point out that I voted for this report on sustainable urban development , known as UR@@ B@@ AN .
As with all other Community initiatives , this is very positive .
Europe is making its presence felt at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of Europe and not simply for the development of an individual State , whi@@ ch@@ ever one it may be .
UR@@ B@@ AN is designed to find solutions to urban dec@@ ay , and this is something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the Pen@@ sion@@ ers &apos; Party .
There can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city .
I hope that this Community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problems faced by the elderly in cities .
.
( DA ) The Left &apos; s five Members of the European Parliament have chosen to support LE@@ AD@@ ER + , the E@@ QU@@ AL initiative and INTER@@ RE@@ G , but not UR@@ B@@ AN .
At a forthcoming review of these programmes , it ought to be established that the EU &apos; s efforts are to be concentrated upon cross-border tasks and adapted to the possible enlargement of the EU .
.
( DA ) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for a Community initiative relating to the economic and social re@@ generation of cities and neigh@@ bour@@ h@@ oods in crisis and designed to promote sustainable development ( UR@@ B@@ AN ) .
Basi@@ cally , we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but , since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used , we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think , in general , that the proposal for re@@ generating neigh@@ bour@@ h@@ oods in crisis contains some sensible observations , as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects .
This report contains general points on what is referred to as the urban re@@ generation strategy for town centres and neigh@@ bour@@ h@@ oods affected by the crisis in the capitalist economy and its consequences , i.e. increasing unemployment , exclusion and del@@ inqu@@ ency .
It under@@ lines the fact that , in order to ensure sustainable urban development , an urban policy must be implemented which does not leave out the main victims of the economic crisis , namely the unemployed , immigrants , refugees , women and the socially excluded .
However , nothing is said about the causes of this crisis and those responsible for it .
At best this report simply correc@@ ts certain aspects and effects of the crisis . Yet only sc@@ andal@@ ously limited resources are available for this work .
This is why we will vote individually in favour of the specific measures planned to help certain social categories which are most disadvantaged but will ab@@ stain on the report itself in order to den@@ ounce the fact that in the main it consists of pi@@ ous hopes financed on the cheap .
- ( FR ) Mrs McCar@@ thy , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased that the UR@@ B@@ AN Community Initiative is being continued as this aims to support the social and economic conversion of cities and neigh@@ bour@@ h@@ oods in crisis , all with a view to achieving sustainable urban development .
With some 80 % of the population of Europe living in an urban area , cities are at the for@@ efront of economic , social and cultural change in Europe .
At the same time , the social and economic problems facing European society are more pron@@ ounced in urban areas .
Many European cities are divided into neigh@@ bour@@ h@@ oods characterised by high-@@ ad@@ de@@ d-@@ value activities and high-@@ income residents and other districts characterised by low incomes , high unemployment , sub@@ standard and over@@ crow@@ ded housing and high levels of welfare dependency .
The concentration of economic and social problems in certain urban areas calls for targeted intervention taking full account of the complexity of the problems involved .
This is why the European Parliament successfully called for the UR@@ B@@ AN Community Initiative or C@@ IP to be extended during the reform of the Structural Funds .
The success of UR@@ B@@ AN during the 199@@ 4-@@ 1999 programming period is indisp@@ utable .
The results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas .
This C@@ IP has encouraged the development of best practice models in the economic , social and environmental sectors .
It has also had the distinction of strengthening the role of local authorities , the non-governmental sector and local communities and of supporting new partnership approaches to urban re@@ generation .
The new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by rein@@ forcing them , while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially margin@@ alised and disadvantaged groups .
We can therefore welcome its adoption .
We must , however , admit that in financial terms we cannot proc@@ la@@ im a victory ! The total appropri@@ ation allocated is not up to the challenge .
The amount for the 199@@ 4-@@ 1999 period was EUR 900 million and will be EUR 700 million for the 2000-@@ 2006 period . This represents a drop of 30 % !
This reduction in funding has led to a reduction in the number of programmes in the new UR@@ B@@ AN initiative .
The chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low .
It needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the Member States .
In view of this concentration on a limited number of projects , the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the results of the new UR@@ B@@ AN Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multip@@ lier effect .
The McCar@@ thy report on the UR@@ B@@ AN Community Initiative gives us an opportunity to reflect on the appropri@@ at@@ eness of Community intervention in urban matters .
The situation of certain urban areas is alarming , with the social dist@@ ress taking the form of unemployment , mis@@ ery and crime .
Dru@@ g dealing in particular fuels in@@ security and del@@ inqu@@ ency .
Fac@@ ed with these social challenges , the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt .
Subsidiar@@ ity should make us realise that the state , exerc@@ ising its governing functions , and local authorities are the bodies most able to intervene appropriately . The state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help disadvantaged people .
Although we welcome the determination to create a system of exchanges between successful enterprises , the problems specific to each urban area cannot be dealt with in the same way .
The UR@@ B@@ AN Community Initiative is helping to achieve the European Union &apos; s desire to comm@@ uni@@ tise urban policy .
It would be more appropriate for the EU to concentrate its financial efforts on pre-@@ existing European policies .
Clearly some people are prof@@ iting from the opportunity to indul@@ ge in another budget bi@@ d@@ ding race which is particularly mis@@ tim@@ ed when the convergence criteria for EMU are imposing a very strict s@@ lim@@ ming regime on the national budgets .
Mrs McCar@@ thy is therefore suggest@@ ing an increase in the funds allocated to UR@@ B@@ AN and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign ext@@ oll@@ ing the benefits of a federal Europe .
We should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure is not measured by the volume of funding allocated to the project .
In fact , the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted .
The aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility .
Finally , the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or soci@@ ological minorities .
We can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion .
On one hand , this policy encourages the integration of immigrants where it should favour their assi@@ mil@@ ation into the culture of the host country . This would prevent the development of ethnic gh@@ et@@ tos which are nothing more than urban powder k@@ eg@@ s .
On the other hand , it manipul@@ ates the principle of positive discrimination . This is a politically correct f@@ ancy which can be just as harmful , as shown by the US precedent .
For all these reasons , the French delegation of the U@@ EN Group could not approve the McCar@@ thy report .
Dec@@ our@@ ri@@ ère report ( A5-00@@ 28 / 2000 )
Mr President , the INTER@@ RE@@ G programme is particularly close to our hearts .
Like many of my colleagues , I am pleased that the European Parliament was able to safeguard this initiative .
As I live in the Sar@@ re-@@ L@@ or-@@ Lu@@ x Su@@ d region of Belgium , I am well aware that the regions are where Europe is being created . They are where we live the European experience on a daily basis and where the people make European construction come alive .
These projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development .
Why am I stres@@ sing this point ?
The answer is quite simply because the projects currently being submitted are still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they are submitted .
For example , to accept new roads is to accept new pollution within the European Union . This goes totally against the policies which we are proposing to fight greenhouse gas emissions , for example .
I would also ask the Commission to ensure that the environmental pillar of the EU &apos; s policy is integrated into the projects submitted and that the goal of reducing CO2 for example forms an experimental added value in the projects proposed .
I am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction .
We know that some Member States are still wa@@ ver@@ ing , for example , between rail and road for routes through vulnerable areas such as the Pyren@@ ees , as in the Asp@@ e valley .
However , I am also thinking of my own region where my government is still debating whether to route the railway or to build a second motorway , the A@@ 32 .
In this respect too , I would ask the Commission to be particularly attentive about ensuring that there is real cohesion between the various policies , specifically in the INTER@@ RE@@ G programmes which are being submitted .
Mr President , I voted for the Dec@@ our@@ ri@@ ère report on the Community initiative INTER@@ RE@@ G , mainly because of the reply Commissioner Barnier gave to some Members who took the floor and asked for this programme to make greater reference to border regions with maritime fron@@ tiers .
I voted for it , not just because I was born in a coastal town , Gen@@ oa , but above all because the fron@@ tiers of regions bor@@ dered by the sea are fron@@ tiers too .
These fron@@ tiers stretch as far as African states and the Middle East : we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions in every part of Europe .
As an MEP from a border region , I welcome this third INTER@@ RE@@ G initiative with great interest .
We can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and land@@ locked border regions which have been cut off economically , socially and cultur@@ ally .
Due to the existence of these borders , they have become peripheral areas within the countries to which they belong . This has too often led the national authorities to negl@@ ect these regions in national policy .
This is why the INTER@@ RE@@ G Community Initiative was launched in 1990 .
This programme was designed to encourage cross-border , transnational and inter@@ regional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union .
INTER@@ RE@@ G serves princip@@ ally to fund Community schemes to develop SMEs , education and training , cultural exchanges , action to combat health problems , the protection and improvement of the environment , energy , transport and telecommunications networks .
I must stress that inter@@ regional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration .
More active participation by these authorities in Community initiatives should be promoted , bearing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal fr@@ ameworks and different levels of development on either side of the border .
In cross-border cooperation , greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertakings which are the job cre@@ ators .
In the same respect , given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50 % of all unemployment , the INTER@@ RE@@ G funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment .
Obst@@ ac@@ les too often caused by double taxation and social protection are preventing , bra@@ king or hin@@ dering cross-border mobility .
I hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region !
INTER@@ RE@@ G resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area .
Finally , and in particular , expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for Objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through INTER@@ RE@@ G !
The challenges are therefore immense . The integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy !
I hope everyone , like Mr Dec@@ our@@ ri@@ ère , whom I congratulate , will realise this !
- ( FR ) The INTER@@ RE@@ G Community Initiative is just one element of an ill-@@ f@@ ated European regional policy .
This apparently generous policy , officially intended to help problem regions , is a f@@ ool &apos; s bar@@ gain for French taxpayers . France contributes 17 % of the European budget yet will receive only 8 % of the regional Structural Funds .
Between 1994 and 1999 , our regions annually received an average of FF 15.@@ 4 billion but will receive only FF 14.@@ 7 billion between 2000 and 2006 .
My region of Nord@@ -@@ Pas@@ -@@ de-@@ Cal@@ ais will be particularly affected with French H@@ ain@@ aut losing the aid paid to Objective 1 regions .
This loss is un@@ justified in a region whose main activities have been ru@@ ined by free-@@ trade Europe .
The European regional policy also rein@@ forces the centr@@ alism of Brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the Structural Funds .
This is a Europe of regions in which the regions , which are weaker than the nation states , will easily submit to Brussels .
The INTER@@ RE@@ G initiative , launched in 1990 to prepare the border regions for a Europe without borders and therefore without nations , si@@ ts comfortably within this philosophy .
However , Mr Dec@@ our@@ ri@@ ère does show some common sense by den@@ o@@ unc@@ ing the fail@@ ings of the Brussels t@@ echno@@ cr@@ ats . These fail@@ ings will result in particular in the late implementation of INTER@@ RE@@ G III and therefore in financial losses for the regions in receipt of aid .
We also agree with the rapporteur about asking for more attention to be paid to small and medium-sized undertakings and , of course , about ref@@ using to use outside service providers . These are the procedures which caused the corruption scandal in the previous Commission .
However , these isolated elements which make sense and for which we voted , in no way remedy the Euro@@ feder@@ alist philosophy which character@@ ises the Community initiatives , particularly INTER@@ RE@@ G .
This is why the National Front voted against the report .
The European Parliament has delivered an opinion on the Commission guidelines for the INTER@@ RE@@ G Community Initiative concerning cross-border , transnational and inter@@ regional cooperation .
I want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative .
This does not involve the concerns about the future of the Atlantic Ar@@ c but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime borders into strand A on cross-border cooperation .
In the Commission guidelines , few maritime areas are eligible for INTER@@ RE@@ G II@@ IA .
The amendments to the Dec@@ our@@ ri@@ ère report aim to make INTER@@ RE@@ G more mari@@ time-@@ oriented .
This is an important development which must be supported as it is the future of the EU which is at stake .
I am aware of the Commission &apos; s reluc@@ t@@ ance on this subject as it announced during the sym@@ posi@@ um on the presentation of INTER@@ RE@@ G III last November .
However , I must point out that preventing the recognition of maritime borders amounts to den@@ ying the existence of an area which has great potential for projects and innovation .
One example of this is the &apos; Cel@@ tic &apos; area which encomp@@ asses the territories of Britt@@ any in France , Corn@@ wall and De@@ von in the United Kingdom and Cor@@ k and Water@@ ford in Ireland . This is an area whose loc@@ ally-@@ based economy is characterised by dependence on the fishing industry and the importance of the agri@@ -@@ foodstuffs sector .
It also has excellent cultural and rel@@ ational links , through tw@@ inn@@ ings for example . INTER@@ RE@@ G III , strand A , would allow the regions in this area to advance a number of structural projects needed to develop small and medium-sized undertakings and to promote research and technical development through knowledge transfer .
The European Commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions .
This policy would have important economic consequences for the fishing industry in Britt@@ any in that cat@@ ches could be un@@ loaded at Irish advance bases in order to then be transported to the Bre@@ ton agri@@ -@@ foodstuffs industry .
The integration of the maritime border into strand A would finally allow the western peripher@@ y to be recognised as a unique and important economic area which is confronted by the &apos; contin@@ ent@@ alisation &apos; of the European Union .
This would show respect for these peripheral areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the east .
The maritime world has great potential .
We therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot Community programmes which will allow the new geographical and economic map of Europe to be defined .
.
( DA ) The European project began as a partnership between States .
This partnership has ensured peace and stability in our part of Europe for over 50 years .
As a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world , of which the EU is just one proof , and in view of the ever greater proliferation of our Western values , competition on the world market has grown considerably within the last few decades .
The EU should be prepared to meet that competition .
We can only do that by intensi@@ fying co-operation within the Community .
It should not be about greater integration of the EU countries in the form of a federation but about using our economic potential across national borders .
It is about co-@@ operating on joint projects and about uni@@ fying forces on all sides .
A programme such as INTER@@ RE@@ G is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders , projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale .
I therefore welcome the continuation of the programme .
.
( FR ) Mr Dec@@ our@@ ri@@ ère &apos; s report is not without merit : at the end of a clear and comprehensive presentation of the INTER@@ RE@@ G initiative and its role in opening up border regions , it comes out in favour of SMEs in paragraph 16 .
I and my colleague Domini@@ que Sou@@ ch@@ et , who is well vers@@ ed in this matter , have tabled five amendments highlighting the role of SMEs and craft tra@@ des within the framework of INTER@@ RE@@ G , the importance of cooperation between undertakings and the need to involve economic and social partners in the design and implementation of the programmes and I welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously .
Nonetheless , the French delegation in our group was unable to accept the fact that the Commission and the feder@@ alist fac@@ tion have diver@@ ted the INTER@@ RE@@ G initiative from its original purpose in order to det@@ ra@@ ct still further from the political role of the nations .
We have no intention of giving Brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the Member States , as suggested in rec@@ ital of the report .
We only ask one thing of the Commission : that it con@@ fine itself to ensuring that the implementation of joint policies does not up@@ set the balance of regional planning in our territories .
The destructive effects of the CAP and EMU on the balance between regions , especially on the vit@@ ality of the more rural , the more remote and the least populated regions , is proof positive of the fact that such ambitions are not a sin@@ ec@@ ure , far from it .
We are therefore unable to approve the development of strand II@@ IC of the Community initiative encouraging inter@@ regional cooperation under the responsibility of the Commission and si@@ del@@ ining the Member States .
This inf@@ at@@ u@@ ation with strand II@@ IC is all the stran@@ ger in that the rapporteur himself acknowled@@ ges in his explanatory statement that &apos; the draft guidelines do not provide any indication of possible fields of co-operation &apos; ( p.@@ 17 ) and that &apos; the responsibilities are diff@@ use and vague &apos; ( p.@@ 18 ) .
C@@ alling under these circumstances , as he does in paragraph 20 , for the budget for this strand to be increased is another example of the irresponsible and ideological out@@ bi@@ d@@ ding tac@@ tics which are custom@@ ary in this House .
Lastly , there is the desire expressed both in the Commission document and Mr Dec@@ our@@ ri@@ ère &apos; s report of using INTER@@ RE@@ G for peace and reconstruction in the Balkans : I do not think that the Structural Funds should be used to repair the damage which the Americans inf@@ lic@@ ted on Serbia during bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ments which were as criminal as they were in@@ eff@@ ec@@ tual .
It is up to Washington , not us , to assume responsibility for a conflict which was trig@@ gered merely to serve its interests .
The French delegation in our group is therefore unable to support the Dec@@ our@@ ri@@ ère report and will choose to ab@@ stain during the final vote .
Proc@@ acci report ( A5-00@@ 25 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted for the Proc@@ acci report on rural development , not only because I endorse the major policy lines of the LE@@ AD@@ ER programme , but also because it compl@@ ements the UR@@ B@@ AN programme , which I spoke about earlier .
Just as elderly people in cities are very isolated , so the elderly are fast becoming the sole inhabitants of rural areas because young people are moving to the cities : they are drawn by the bright lights , and the pubs , and the countryside and rural areas are being emp@@ tied .
I therefore believe that it is very important for everyone to back this European Union plan and for it to be further developed .
- ( PT ) Although this Community initiative , LE@@ AD@@ ER + , follows on from previous initiatives , it has some unique features .
One of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period .
Nevertheless , new objectives have been included , specifically the financing of the Nature Network 2000 , for which all rural regions will be eligible .
In spite of the fact that this Community initiative is aimed at rural development , it does not address the issues of agriculture and agricultural production in a consistent way , and this is unacceptable .
Without agriculture , the rural world will disappear .
This means that any strategy for rural development must be based on agriculture &apos; s internal potential while at the same time developing as many other activities as possible in order to prevent the deser@@ ti@@ fication of the rural world .
This is why we considered it essential to improve the report by means of our proposals deliberately to include agricultural activity and farmers in the strategy for rural development and to request more appropriations in order not to threaten the survival of the programme in those rural regions which were covered before . We also want to ensure that the new programme continues to priori@@ tise the less@@ -@@ favoured regions .
Our position on LE@@ AD@@ ER is a product of our more general assessment of the EU &apos; s overall agricultural policy .
Both LE@@ AD@@ ER 1 and LE@@ AD@@ ER 2 , which were implemented in the 1990s , were ingredients of the new CAP that emerged after its review in 1992 and , along with other respective measures , they con@@ stituted the so-@@ ter@@ med second pillar of the EU &apos; s rural development policy .
Their real aim was to moderate and dis@@ gu@@ ise the new CAP &apos; s disastrous consequences and the dis@@ orientation of small and medium-@@ scale farmers , and not to develop the rural areas or retain the agricultural population ther@@ ein as was hypo@@ cri@@ tically declared in their objectives .
This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented , farming incomes and employment decre@@ ased rapidly , which resulted in their dep@@ op@@ ulation .
A characteristic example is Greece , which as an Objective 1 country was included as a whole in the LE@@ AD@@ ER Community initiatives , and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reached approximately 2.@@ 3 % , while between 1994 and 1999 farming incomes decre@@ ased by 15.@@ 2 % .
We think LE@@ AD@@ ER + will be even more in@@ eff@@ ec@@ tual than LE@@ AD@@ ER 1 and LE@@ AD@@ ER 2 , for the following reasons .
The real aims of LE@@ AD@@ ER + are the same as those of LE@@ AD@@ ER@@ s 1 and 2 , in other words to moderate and dis@@ gu@@ ise the negative consequences of the CAP to be implemented in the context of Agenda 2000 and the WTO .
The present CAP , however , is worse than its predecessor and it also starts from a worse basis , granted that the 1992 CAP review and the GAT@@ T agreement in 1995 have created serious problems and im@@ passes for the agricultural economy .
The selection criteria and the activities that are subsi@@ dis@@ ed under LE@@ AD@@ ER do , in the best case , moderate some partial problems of the countryside , which are of secondary importance , but in the worst case they de@@ generate into expenditure for the sake of public relations and p@@ ander@@ ing to conscience .
In no case , however , are they programmes for the integrated development of the selected areas and they do not create permanent jobs in the countryside because most of the activities there are not productive in nature .
The actual appropriations available for LE@@ AD@@ ER + compared with LE@@ AD@@ ER 2 are smaller despite their increase by 15 % ( from EUR 1 7@@ 75 million for LE@@ AD@@ ER 2 to EUR 2 0@@ 20 million for LE@@ AD@@ ER + ) . This is because the 15 % increase is nomin@@ al and not real , granted that average y@@ early inflation in the Community during those years was approximately 2 % .
LE@@ AD@@ ER + will last a year longer than LE@@ AD@@ ER 2 .
LE@@ AD@@ ER + can cover all the regions of the EU , while LE@@ AD@@ ER 2 covered only the Objective 1 regions and some Objective 5@@ b and 6 regions .
We disagree with many of the report &apos; s views .
Once more , we point to the negative changes of the CAP ( 1992 - Agenda 2000 ) .
We do not think LE@@ AD@@ ER + will contribute substan@@ tively towards solving the countryside &apos; s problems , which are characterised by the decline of farming , which was and should remain the countryside &apos; s basic social and economic branch .
For our part , we will tell the farmers about the ex@@ pedi@@ ency of these programmes .
We will make every effort to improve them as much as possible and prevent them from being wast@@ ed , and most important of all , we will try to foster the struggle of farmers against the disastrous CAP which is dis@@ inher@@ iting them and leading them towards economic decline and the deser@@ tion of the countryside .
Unless this CAP is over@@ thrown , no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-@@ scale farmers and the social and economic re@@ generation of the countryside .
All the Members in the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voted in favour of almost the whole of the Proc@@ acci report on the LE@@ AD@@ ER + Community Initiative .
However , we amended the draft report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to clarify certain points which will make this Community initiative more effective .
In particular we felt it was necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedures which proved to be too cum@@ ber@@ some and slow in the LE@@ AD@@ ER II initiative .
It was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of LE@@ AD@@ ER + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density .
Amendment No 10 which I tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of &apos; economic and social cohesion &apos; rather than &apos; regional development &apos; as the European Union does not have any recognised competence in this area .
Amendment No 11 re@@ places &apos; government or municipal officials &apos; with &apos; government officials &apos; . Although local action groups should consist of a balanced and representative selection of partners drawn from the different socio-economic sectors of the territory concerned , government officials must be involved at decision-making level , whether they come from the municip@@ alities , departments , regions or national governments .
The rapporteur &apos; s phr@@ asing was therefore too limiting .
Amendment No 12 respon@@ ds to the expectations of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism of this House . It speci@@ fies the necessary coordination between LE@@ AD@@ ER + and Community cooperation and partnership programmes such as INTER@@ RE@@ G , PH@@ ARE , S@@ ap@@ ard or ME@@ DA .
In the territory of Member States of the European Union , applicant countries or Member States of E@@ FT@@ A , there may be inter@@ relations between the various Community initiatives .
The real priority for the European continent is to establish an operational level within a European framework and not a global framework as proposed by the rapporteur .
The creation of organisations similar to the LA@@ G@@ s may be us@@ efully encouraged by the European Union , provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners .
In essence , we are , of course , in favour of this LE@@ AD@@ ER + Community Initiative .
The conference on rural development held in Cor@@ k from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union &apos; s priorities since it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric , including infrastructure , public and private services and so on .
In this context , in committee we reg@@ ret@@ ted the pal@@ try funding all@@ ot@@ ted to rural development and supported the amendments calling for an increased budget for this Community initiative so that it matches the previous LE@@ AD@@ ER I and LE@@ AD@@ ER II initiatives .
The budget allocated to LE@@ AD@@ ER + for a period of seven years is half that allocated to LE@@ AD@@ ER II for a period of six years .
This is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid specified in the reform of the CAP following the Berlin agreements .
Finally , among the priority parameters to be introduced at European level to enable local involvement , particular attention must be paid to the quality and origin@@ ality of projects which have already been implemented by LA@@ G@@ s within the LE@@ AD@@ ER II initiative , but which could not be concluded due to the timetable and weight of the management mechanisms specified .

Addi@@ tives in feed@@ ing@@ stuffs
The next item is the report ( A5-00@@ 15 / 2000 ) by Mr Gra@@ efe zu Bar@@ ing@@ dorf , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70 / 5@@ 24 / EEC concerning additives in feed@@ ing@@ stuffs ( COM ( 1999 ) 3@@ 88 - C5-0@@ 13@@ 4 / 1999 - 1999 / 0@@ 16@@ 8 ( CNS ) ) .
Mr President , Commissioner Byr@@ ne , under Directive 70 / 5@@ 24 , high-@@ technology additives are treated differently , depending on the date of authorisation .
The Commission has proposed harmon@@ ising the authorisation procedure so that substances licensed before 1988 are put on an equal footing with substances authorised now .
As far as we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned , so far so good .
However , the directive also encomp@@ asses the authorisation of antibio@@ tics , drugs , grow@@ th-@@ promo@@ ters and gene@@ tic@@ ally-@@ modified organisms .
That makes it a question of health , not just approxim@@ ating laws , which is why we in the Committee on Agriculture take the view that the legal base - Article 37 - is not ad@@ missible here and that the Commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of Article 15@@ 2 , that is to say with codecision by Parliament .
We asked the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , which pointed out that , as far as approxim@@ ating laws is concerned , Article 37 is adequate in this case .
However , we in the Committee on Agriculture have not confined ourselves to approxim@@ ating laws ; because this proposal also encomp@@ asses gene@@ tic@@ ally-@@ modified organisms , we have tabled a further proposed amendment which affects the content and hence public health .
We negotiated with the Commission for two years on the seed directive and came to a compromise regulating the release of gene@@ tic@@ ally-@@ modified organisms in the directive , taking the text on which Directive 70 / 5@@ 24 is based as a starting point .
Mr Byr@@ ne , we fail to understand why the Commission is not approxim@@ ating the text on gene@@ tic@@ ally-@@ modified organisms as part of its harmonisation work .
We have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text .
Moreover , this text has also been adopted in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently needs to be adopted in this directive as well .
The Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future .
However , that should not prevent us from harmon@@ ising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives .
We are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to gene@@ tic@@ ally-@@ modified organisms .
Directive 70 / 5@@ 24 still contains the old text because the seed directive was submitted to Parliament in 1986 and we then negotiated with the Commission until 1988 , while the report on this directive was dealt with in 1994 and Parliament obviously did not acc@@ ord gene@@ tic@@ ally-@@ modified organisms the same importance then as it did later when I was rapporteur .
We therefore assume , Commissioner Byr@@ ne , that you too will accept our proposed amendment of the legal base .
If you do not , we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you , exactly as we did with the seed directive . I should point out that the text which we have now worked out is a valid compromise , both for your legal service and ours .
In other words , we do not need to re-@@ negotiate the text ; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive .
I can hardly wait , Commissioner Byr@@ ne , to hear what you have to say to our proposals .
Mr President , Commissioner , does regulating additives in feed@@ ing@@ stuffs come under competition or consumer policy ?
As far the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee are concerned , it comes under competition .
Of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feed@@ ing@@ stuffs industry by harmon@@ ising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988 .
We want to prevent the prices of feed@@ ing@@ stuffs from rising and Mr Do@@ yle &apos; s proposed Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support .
However , as Mr Gra@@ efe zu Bar@@ ing@@ dorf has said in his report , this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter .
Food safety must take absolute priority over feed@@ ing@@ stuffs in all our discussions .
When we talk of transparency in the food chain , that applies from the ha@@ y@@ for@@ k to the table for@@ k and consumer protection therefore log@@ ically starts with feed@@ ing@@ stuffs .
The antibio@@ tics , growth promo@@ ters and gene@@ tic@@ ally-@@ modified organisms mixed in with feed@@ ing@@ stuffs end up in the human food chain .
The diox@@ in scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this m@@ ess once and for all and regulating additives in feed@@ ing@@ stuffs is a step in the right direction .
According to Article 15@@ 2 of the EC Treaty , we are obliged to ob@@ vi@@ ate sources of danger to human health , whereby the acc@@ ent is clearly on sources .
Consequently , we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger , i.e. harmful additives in feed@@ ing@@ stuffs .
Otherwise , in my view , we are be@@ aver@@ ing away at the symptoms , but not the causes .
People are especially war@@ y of GMOs .
We must confront increasing public awareness of GMOs by regulating their use in feed@@ ing@@ stuffs accordingly .
First , if an addi@@ tive consists of or contains gene@@ tic@@ ally-@@ modified organisms , then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment .
Secondly , it makes sense to issue provisions for gene@@ tic@@ ally-@@ modified feed@@ ing@@ stuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation , as the rapporteur has said .
And thir@@ dly , if we are to have a transparent consumer policy , we need to label gene@@ tic@@ ally-@@ modified feed@@ ing@@ stuffs .
A clear declaration on feed@@ ing@@ stuffs will allow double freedom of choice , both for the party using the feed@@ ing@@ stuff and the subsequent consumer .
Respon@@ sible citizens should , in my view , have a choice .
We all talk of sc@@ and@@ alised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety .
By regulating additives in feed@@ ing@@ stuffs consistently , we can help significantly to restore confidence .
I too , therefore , can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments .
Consequently , we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be .
Mr President , this proposal to amend the 1970 directive on additives in feed@@ ing@@ stuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feed@@ ing@@ stuffs .
In other words , we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months .
That this subject is of par@@ amount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the diox@@ in , antibio@@ tic , s@@ lu@@ dge and other sc@@ and@@ als have attracted .
In other words , this is an important fac@@ et of public health protection , which is why we believe that Article 15@@ 2 should be taken as the legal base , not Article 37 , as proposed by the Commission .
The amendment which the Commission has proposed , namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 December 1987 , is un@@ cont@@ ested and has our full support .
However , the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal .
The regulation proposed by the Commission conc@@ eals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives .
Only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded .
This sort of monopoly , which could lead , for example , to an increase in the price of feed@@ ing@@ stuffs , should be prevented by granting pro@@ visi@@ onal authorisation to all companies which had mark@@ eted a specific substance by 1 April 1998 .
This would then apply until the re-@@ assessment procedure has been completed .
The most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion , as recommended by the rapporteur , of gene@@ tic@@ ally-@@ modified organisms in the directive on additives , taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point .
This already gives us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs .
It is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feed@@ ing@@ stuff additives in this case , just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas , such as forest reproductive material , to mention just one example .
The labelling of gene@@ tic@@ ally-@@ modified additives is particularly important in this respect .
On the one hand , it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feed@@ ing@@ stuffs and , on the other hand , it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using GMOs .
Finally , our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur , who has gone to a great deal of trouble .
I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byr@@ ne &apos; s reply .
Mr President , the report deals mainly with form@@ alities , in other words , the manner in which additives will be authorised .
It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work .
I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that , in future , all the directives are dealt with under Article 15@@ 2 , since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview .
We cannot carry on as we have done up until now , that is to say dealing with each detail on its own , often only after the harm has already been done .
The rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of GMOs in feed additives .
However , I should like once again to raise the issue of antibio@@ tics .
Certainly , five of the nine antibio@@ tics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned . It is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four , both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves .
We now know that resistance to antibio@@ tics poses a very serious threat to people &apos;s health , particularly in the case of small children .
A number of Member States are already able to show conclu@@ sively that impro@@ per practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary .
Several countries ph@@ ased out antibio@@ tics in animal feed@@ ing@@ stuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same .
We talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but , in the case of antibio@@ tics , it has long since been forgotten .
However , there is another environmental principle at stake , namely the exchange principle .
I should like to say a few words about co@@ c@@ ci@@ di@@ o@@ stat@@ s .
They are a zo@@ ot@@ echni@@ cal product which is not totally necessary . There is a substitute , which is used to vacc@@ in@@ ate ch@@ ick@@ ens .
Although it is a little more expensive , it does not harm the environment .
Co@@ c@@ ci@@ di@@ o@@ stat@@ s now accompany the man@@ ure that is spread on the fields . In that way , they end up in our water supplies which , as we all know , are our most vital resource .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report on additives in animal feed@@ ing@@ stuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feed@@ ing@@ stuffs and between producers of these additives .
Yet after the serious diox@@ in crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition . You may recall , even though this passed virtually un@@ noticed by the general public , that the Commission &apos; s scientific experts discovered industrial resi@@ du@@ es of diox@@ in-@@ loaded chemical li@@ me in the pul@@ p of cit@@ rus fruit imported from Brazil .
We must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feed@@ ing@@ stuffs for production animals .
In@@ ci@@ dentally , it is ir@@ onic that the problem is much less serious for the feed@@ ing@@ stuffs of our dogs , c@@ ats and other domestic animals .
Is it because of cut@@ -@@ thro@@ at and glob@@ alised competition that industri@@ alists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri@@ -@@ foodstuffs industry ?
Such a serious issue cannot be limited to a technical debate , even though it is the directive itself which limits the authorisation of antibio@@ tics and other growth promo@@ ters .
The precau@@ tions which we are preparing to take in respect of feed@@ ing@@ stuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our plates .
As for@@ c@@ efully under@@ lined by this report , labelling is an absolute necessity so that each far@@ mer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock .
He must also know whether his bag of protein gran@@ ules includes GMOs as these components could represent a risk to public health .
In any case , the precautionary principle requires these products to be clearly trac@@ eable at all stages of their marketing .
However , before labelling we need clear rules .
Stra@@ i@@ ght questions must be asked about the real end-@@ use of animal meal , for example .
Although we are looking at all the problems caused by these products in ethical and health terms , it is their use which must be ques@@ tioned today .
In this respect , the chapter of the White Paper on food safety which deals with feed@@ ing@@ stuffs must serve as a working basis for going beyond mere commercial questions .
The Commission has on many occasions used the farm@@ -to-@@ table example which our colleague in the PPE Group has just under@@ lined .
This is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and , to do this , the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time .
This is why it is essential to approve Amendment No 2 to Rec@@ ital 4 which avoi@@ ds the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an addi@@ tive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re-@@ evaluation procedure .
Also , Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2@@ a must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such , thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions .
Mr President , because of the availability of high-@@ technology additives in the feed@@ ing@@ stuffs industry , detailed information on their use is needed from the actors , and as we know there are a lot of them , so that we can put a stop to practices which infrin@@ ge Community law .
This directive on additives in feed@@ ing@@ stuffs cannot achieve this on its own .
Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them .
Up the point at which meat , milk , bread and other products are sold over the shop counter , feed@@ ing@@ stuffs and additives are structured , mixed , bl@@ ended , cut and transported several times .
The fight by feed@@ ing@@ stuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems , just as it does in the foodstuffs industry .
